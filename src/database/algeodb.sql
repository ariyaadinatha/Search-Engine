Ayanokoji Group meeting - Yukimura reveals, that no one from the first years got expelled. Sakura says she wants the classes to be equal so everyone can graduate from class A. Miyake says that theres a rumour that a special test will be held to decide their ranking if they end 3rd year with equally as many points. Ayanokoji notices that Sakura has become more talkative. Miyake brings up that class C seems strange recently. He has realised that Ryuuens pawns have been following them around lately. They cant confront them due to a lack of evidence and fear of being painted as the bad guy. Ayanokoji notes that another class has been spying on them, which Miyake hasnt noticed.  He starts thinking, that Ryuuen has already narrowed the suspected people down into a small group that contains him and Karuizawa. He states its a question of when Ryuuen uses Karuizawa to figure him out. The others reveal, that theres now only an 80 point gap between class D and C and that class C had an incident, where they lost 100 class points. The group suspects that class C is self-destructing. Ayanokoji suspects, that Ryuuen got private points in return for him using their S-points for partying and giving Katsuragi the leftovers. They start talking about relationships with Hasebe teases the boys. As they talk about their plans for Christmas Sakura starts laughing and crying from happiness of being able to talk like this to people. They then decide to go for dinner. While the group goes to dinner, Ayanokoji excuses himself to go to the toilet, but actually goes to confront the girl tailing him, class As Kamuro. He starts openly thinking of reasons why shed tail him, threatening to report her bad job to Sakayanagi. He gets her to reveal that Sakayanagi is using her weakness to make her tail him. After she threatens to tip-off Ryuuen that hes X, he proposes that she can keep tailing him but to only report to Sakayanagi in exchange that Ryuuen isnt tipped off or anyone for that matter.

The ones who showed up were Ryuuen, Ishizaki, and Yamada Albert (also Komiya and Kondou). Ryuuen says hes come to warn them. In the tense atmosphere, the only one able to move as if nothings happening is Kouenji, who leaves. Ryuuens target was Kouenji as he sends his men after him. Ayanokoji notes that Kushidas role has become far less present but not faded, as the class gossips.\r\n\r\nAyanokoji, Miyake with some other people go to check on Kouenji. Someone (I cant remember) suggest hes going back to the dorm. As they head towards the dorms they see class C surround Kouenji. Class D decides to just observe for now. Kouenji acts like Kouenji (arrogant) but realizes Ryuuen wont let him go until they finish their business so they go to a rest area.\r\n\r\nAyanokoji suspects that this was just a ploy to narrow down the people who could be X.

Sakayanagi then reveals that the deal was that class C support class A in exchange for monthly paid private points.

(Sasha)\n\nI look at her face.\n\nWha.what.? What are you looking at? (Sasha)\n\nSasha covers her face with both arms to hide from my view.\n\nYouve got new hair ribbons. (Arnos)\n\nThe ribbons she ties her twin tails with are different to the usual ones.\n\nWell noticed\n\nMy demon eyes arent that cloudy where they wont notice the equipment of my subordinates. (Arnos)\n\nSashas eyes look a little disappointed.\n\nCan you not call it equipment? (Sasha)\n\nSasha turns away in a huff, however, from the back she seems to be in a good mood.\n\nSasha is shy because Arnos noticed. Misha says from the seat to my other side.\n\nThe hair ribbons? (Arnos)\n\nMisha nods.\n\nI see. If that made you happy Sasha then why not say? (Arnos)\n\nWhat are you saying? And dont go saying weird things either Misha. (Sasha)\n\nMisha blinks a couple of times and looks at me.\n\nI got scolded. (Misha)\n\nDont worry about it. Shes always noisy over something. (Arnos)\n\nSasha glares at me with an offended expression.\n\nHey Arnos. Whats that supposed to mean? You saying I flare up needlessly? (Sasha)\n\nIf you dont then why not try being honest Sasha?  You wont get what you want if you dont. (Arnos)\n\nSasha falls silent for a moment.\n\n..What do you mean when you say what I want..? (Sasha)\n\nDid you think I hadnt noticed? (Arnos)\n\n.Eh..ah.. (Sasha)\n\nDont you want it? (Arnos)\n\nSasha blushes, turns her eyes away and looks down.\n\n..I want it.. (Sasha)\n\nI pointed to her hair ribbon.\n\nThe material is silk and not just any silk. Its the Konginu silk (dark silk) expelled by the twilight gecko that only spits out the thread while its twilight. They are a remnant from 2000 years ago. It was probably produced in the western Arileo region that has its origins in silk clothing. The silk is strong and its easy to apply reinforcement magic to. Due to that, it was useful during the war but since there has been a long period of peace the techniques were probably converted to ornamental and accessory use. Is dying things using magic a product of this era? Its a dark colour when viewed with demon eyes but its not bad. Id rate it somewhere in the lower middle overall. (Arnos)\n\nSasha had been looking at me with a straight, serious face since halfway through.\n\nIts a different reaction to what I was expecting.\n\nI turn to Misha.\n\nWhats wrong? (Arnos)\n\n.Its not good to notice too much.. (Misha)\n\nFumu. Is that so?\n\nI thought youd be happy. (Arnos)\n\n*Fufu* laughter leaks from my neighbour.\n\nIm not happy with it. Study peace more demon king-sama. (Sasha)\n\nSasha pokes fun at me.\n\nIts strange. Overall she still seems happy.\n\nMorning. (Ray)\n\nGood morning! (Misa)\n\nRay and Misa enter and take their seats.\n\nI see you two are brazenly coming to school together. Sasha says in a low voice.\n\nEh? Ah, no youre wrong. We just met by chance. (Misa)\n\nMisa quickly makes an excuse.\n\nHmph. By chance huh. (Sasha)\n\nThat reminds me Arnos-sama. What happened to Eleonor-san and Zeshia-san since then? (Misa)\n\nMisa forcibly changes the topic.\n\nAah. Well, I thought about it in various ways an (Arnos)\n\nJust then the bell signalling the start of lessons rang out.\n\n\n \nThe door opens and Menou enters followed by 2 girls.\n\nTheres your answer. (Arnos)\n\nMisa looks over and there is Eleonor and Zeshia wearing the hero academy uniform.\n\nApparently, Zeshia is 10 years old and this is the Zeshia that asked me to help [Mama].\n\n\n \nApart from this Zeshia, the rest would find it difficult to adapt to academy life so they are being looked after in a different way.\n\nYes yes everyone take your seats. Im going to introduce two academy exchange students but Im sure everyone already knows who they are. (Menou)\n\nEleonor smiles.\n\nIm Eleonor Bianca from the hero academy. (Eleonor)\n\nEven though Eleonor had introduced herself Zeshia was looking around restlessly as if she didnt understand where she was.\n\n\n \nThis child is Zeshia Bianca. She doesnt speak much but she understands perfectly fine. Cmon Zeshia, say hello. (Eleonor)\n\nAfter being told by Eleonor Zeshia faces the students.\n\n.ImZeshia Bianca (Zeshia)\n\nShe bows her head.\n\nThe students start being noisy at the sight of these two people.\n\nHero academy? Are we still doing an exchange.?\n\nAah. Didnt Azeshion start the war?\n\nThanks to the demon king of tyranny the war was soon over but is now the time for an exchange?\n\nMenou sternly responded to the students talking like that.\n\n\n \nI understand everyones anxiety. Deiruheido and Azeshion just went to war after all, however, that was the plot of Diego Ijeishka the former headteacher of the hero academy. Not all humans had hostility towards the mazoku though. (Menou)\n\nThis has already been communicated to the people of Deiruheido.\n\n\n \nSince the war never reached any cities hardly anyone had the feeling that there had even been a war at all so many people happily accepted it.\n\nIts a bit different with the students here though since they had been imprisoned in the hero academy dormitories until the war had ended. Due to that some of them might find it hard to accept.\n\nAzeshion offered this exchange in a show of friendship towards Deiruheido again and that is why Deruzogedo decided to accept Eleonor-san and Zeshia-san. (Menou)\n\n\n \nSome of the students still show dissatisfaction with Menous explanation.\n\n..Even if you say that, trust doesnt come that easily\n\nThey just made that Deigo guy look bad because they lost the war. It doesnt alter the fact the whole hero academy tried to start a war.\n\nHow do we know its just the academy? It could be the whole of Azeshion.\n\n\n \nYeah, I mean who said I would like to continue the academy exchange?\n\nAah, they insulted the demon king of tyranny. I dont think we can easily interact with each other.\n\nAs a member of the royals how can I accept someone who insults the founder?\n\nIt seems many of the royals are complaining, though rather than the whole of Azeshion it seems its the hero academy they mainly have issues with.\n\nYes yes, I understand everyones dissatisfaction an (Menou)\n\nHahaha.\n\nLaughter echoes in the classroom.\n\nA tall man was standing in the doorway of the classroom looking in.\n\nHe was a delicate-looking man with purple hair and eyes wearing a teachers robe though the robes were white which was unusual since it meant he wasnt a royal.\n\nThis man is even older than the seven elder demon emperors.\n\nHis face is known to me though I didnt hear anything about him coming.\n\nAlso\n\nYou guys are funny.\n\nThe man walks to the podium.\n\nAah, you can both sit down now.\n\nAt his words, Eleonor and Zeshia come over to me and take the two free seats behind me.\n\nThanks for your help Arnos-kun. (Eleonor)\n\nYouve already thanked me once. (Arnos)\n\n*Giggle* I can say it as much as I want. My best regards going forward. (Eleonor)\n\nAah. (Arnos)\n\nWhile answering Eleonor I was watching the man on the podium.\n\nWhats wrong? Eleonor asks me with a curious voice.\n\nNothing. Its no big deal. (Arnos)\n\nMenou goes to the blackboard and starts writing.\n\nAs it stands the academy exchange is going forward. I know youre dissatisfied but they had nothing to do with it. If you actually spend the time and talk to them I think youll find that Eleonor-san isnt someone who makes trouble. (Menou)\n\nMenou finishes writing on the board.\n\nEldomade Ditijon\n\nWell then, one more introduction for you all. I said before youd be getting a new teacher and theyve finally come. (Menou)\n\nThe man steps forward.\n\nIm Eldomade and Ill be granting knowledge to those of you who are ignorant about 2000 years ago. (Eldomade)\n\nThe students frown at his arrogant words.\n\nAn incompetent teacher whos not a royal.\n\nOne of the students quietly mutters this and Menou quickly speaks up.\n\nEldomade sensei is an excellent person and theres a reason hes not a member of the royalty. Sensei is a mazoku born even before the seven elder demon emperors. He both competed against and cooperated with the demon king of tyranny during the great war 2000 years ago. This person fought for the mazoku. I think youll find the knowledge and magic of sensei to be very useful. (Menou)\n\nThe students reaction is dull to the words of Menou.\n\nLets start with the shallowness of you guys. Eldomade says while looking down on the students.\n\nFirst of all, it was the demon king of tyranny that decided on this academy exchange. (Eldomade)\n\nThe students become noisy.\n\nAnd another thing. His name is not Avos Dillheavia. Its partly the fault of Deiruheido but that name and legend has been passed on by mistake. (Eldomade)\n\nThe students get even noisier.\n\nFinally, the reincarnated demon king is here in this classroom. (Eldomade)\n\nHaaa!?\n\nWhat are you talking about.?\n\n..I dont think he is\n\nEldomade turned his gaze to me while the students complained.\n\nYo, its been a while. Your reincarnation seems to have gone well demon king Arnos Voldigod.\nAt Eldomades words, the classroom erupted into noise.\n\nAre you stupid?\n\nBullshit.\n\nIts not good to criticise the royals.\n\nThis was mixed in with other voices saying.\n\nIts come.\n\nArnos-samas era has come.\n\nArnos-samas legend is rising.\n\nThe classroom descended into chaos.\n\nA male student stood up and banged his desk. Its probably one of the royals.\n\nWait a minute. Even if you are a teacher I cant let that go. Are you saying the demon king of tyranny is Arnos? He is the only person branded as inept in the whole academy. You must know the aptitude tests are there to determine the identity of the demon king of tyranny right?\n\n\n \nThe student from the royal faction made a logical statement.\n\nGood grief sensei. You might belong to the unification faction but dont teach your students false information!\n\nThats right. Isnt this an abuse of power?\n\nIve never even heard of a sensei that wears the white clothes. I dont know if you are a 2000-year-old mazoku or not but the issues caused by you elder mazoku have been left behind.\n\nThe criticism from the royal faction comes thick and fast but when Menou starts to say something Eldomade stops her.\n\n\n \nSuch ignorance. Eldomade spits his words out. What is wrong is the history of the mazoku and the teachings of the demon king academy. The mazoku from 2000 years ago deliberately lied to protect the demon king of tyranny. (Eldomade)\n\nThe royals are of course sceptical.\n\nEven in your ignorance, the war we just had between Deiruheido and Azeshion must still be fresh in your memories. Azeshion was planning to destroy the reborn demon king of tyranny even after 2000 years. The mazoku created a fake demon king of tyranny to protect him. Its more complicated than that though so Ill finish there. (Eldomade)\n\nEldomade strongly speaks his factual words.\n\nThat fake demon kings name was Avos Dillheavia which you all believed until today. (Eldomade)\n\nVarious emotions float around the room. Some brushed it off, some got angry and some laughed and snorted. The reactions were varied but the common theme was the royal students didnt believe it.\n\n\n \nThe real demon king Arnos Voldigod was branded inept so even if he was discovered no one would believe it. It worked out very well and thanks to you royals, in particular, the humans never found out. Since the mastermind over on the Azeshion side was destroyed theres no need to hide the demon king anymore. (Eldomade)\n\nEldomade deploys a magic formation.\n\nOpen your eyes and see reality. The one you have branded as inept is the demon king of tyranny. (Eldomade)\n\nIt was a <Zekt> Eldomade deployed.\n\nIt stated that every word Eldomade had just spoken was the truth and the price of breaking this contract was the users life.\n\nIt had been signed by many famous mazoku as well. Particularly notable names on the list were all of the old seven demon emperors.\n\n\n \nOi.wait. That <Zekt> has been signed. Look. Melheys-sama, Aivis-sama..Idol-sama\n\nAll the old seven demon emperors have signed!\n\nIts got to be a lie.. but the old seven demon emperors have signed it?\n\nImpossible! This is impossible. That fellow is an inept white clothes!\n\nHes not noble like us\n\nEldomade turned to me again.\n\nArnos Voldigod. (Eldomade)\n\nHe pointed to the podium at the front.\n\nHere. (Eldomade)\n\nFumu. Whats he planning?\n\nI stood up and walked over to the platform.\n\nDisappear. (Eldomade)\n\nWhen Eldomade spoke all the chairs and desks in the classroom disappeared.\n\nThe students who were sitting down managed to remain upright just about and regained their posture.\n\n\n \nIm not a subordinate of the demon king but I must say your behaviour is intolerable. It shows just how peaceful these times are. (Eldomade)\n\nThe girls in the fan union react immediately and kneel on the spot.\n\nThen Sasha, Misha, Ray and Misa also kneel.\n\nWhat are you doing? Eldomade says to the students who are standing there dumbfounded and unable to comprehend the current situation.\n\nYoure in the presence of the demon king yet your heads are still high. (Eldomade)\n\n\n \nMenou reacts to his words and kneels in front of me.\n\nShe meets my eyes and whispers\n\nI heard everything from Melheys-sama. (Menou)\n\nBecause Menou knelt other students also followed suit.\n\nThe only people left standing are the royals.\n\nThe very reality they believed in right up to today has been upset. Of course they wont be able to easily accept it.\n\nWhy arent you kneeling? Are you willing to commit treason against the demon king of tyranny? Eldomade addresses the standing students.\n\n\n \nNno..buteverything that has been taught to us up to now.\n\nIgnorant man. Ive already told you it was a lie. (Eldomade)\n\nBut having to suddenly believe it just because someone tells us its a lie\n\nYour feelings on the matter are irrelevant. Eldomade flatly rejects the students words.\n\nEverything is an illusion. You royals are not noble and irreplaceable. You have no privilege. The demon king believes those under his command are all equal. (Eldomade)\n\nThe student strongly grits his teeth.\n\nThe curtain already came down long ago. As for the position known as royalty, that fictitious organisation will not be necessary for Deiruheido in the future either. Theres nothing more ridiculous than still playing your role when the play is over is there? Hmm? (Eldomade)\n\nThe students look down in frustration but they couldnt escape the signed <Zekt>.\n\nThey cant argue against the old seven demon emperors since the activities of the royals have always been supported by them.\n\nThey slowly knelt in place their faces stained with humiliation and their hands and feet shaking.\n\nYour words. (Eldomade)\n\nI guess. (Arnos)\n\nI pointed with my finger and drew as many magic circles as there were students in the room. The chairs and desks that had disappeared earlier reappeared.\n\nAnyway, sit down. (Arnos)\n\nThe students were puzzled by my words.\n\nDeiruheido is peaceful now. Theres no longer any need for the demon king of tyranny. If you want to recognise me then do so. If you dont then dont. Everyone should live as they like and this age is perfect for that. Let your beliefs alone be your master. (Arnos)\n\nYes Arnos-sama!!\n\nThe students raise their voices. My fan club played a key role but other students also raised their voices.\n\nThe white-clothed students had faces that were free of any anxiety but in comparison, the royals had bitter expressions on their faces.\n\nWell, whatever. It cant be helped. The only thing Kanon told the mazoku in Deiruheido was the demon king would be reborn into a noble family.\n\nUnfortunately, they took that story and turned their society into one that valued blood and lineage giving special privileges to those that had it.\n\nThe only reason the old seven demon emperors called themselves royals was so they could stand at the top of it and put at least some minimal restraints on the royals to stop them going too far overboard.\n\nThe humiliation and anguish they are feeling is nothing but the result of their own ugly emotions.\n\nFrom now on whenever the history of the mazoku is corrected they will suffer but that is a natural consequence of their own self-made actions.\n\nThe only choice they have is to overcome it themselves.\n\nYou will all notice from now on that history will be corrected. I dont dare say this how I normally would but even so I need to make one correction. (Arnos)\n\nI dont know if my words will reach them but I have to say it.\n\nMy blood was never precious. Its the same as any other mazoku. Theres no precious power in it. If its said there is then it dwells in my heart. Your thoughts and beliefs determine how noble your power is. Polish your heart and mind. Become troubled, lost and confused. What you call precious and honourable will never be obtained while sitting still. (Arnos)\n\nYes Arnos-sama!!\n\nThe royals look humiliated and can only stare at the floor.\n\nIts not unusual to believe something false. Though the scale is huge this situation is the same. Dont entrust your beliefs and values to others otherwise, you can easily find yourself undermined. Live as a mazoku and not as a royal or a mixed race. (Arnos)\n\nYes Arnos-sama!!\n\nSo as I said earlier sit down. Im just a student now. (Arnos)\n\nThe students finally rise to their feet as do Ray, Misha, Sasha and Misa.\n\nRight. Everyone pull yourselves together. Eldomade sensei will be teaching this class from now on. If any of you have any questions from our previous lessons please come to the 3rd year classroom. Also.

Because of his overwhelming prowess, Anos possesses an easygoing attitude and an unrivaled sense of perseverance when facing any challenge that may come his way.\r\n\r\nDespite his title as the Demon King, Anos has a definitive moral compass and generally has a kind and caring outlook. He takes a great interest in the well-being of not only his family, but also his subordinates and followers, and is quick to reward them for their loyalty. He is willing to go through great lengths to assist in their development, in order for them to reach their full potential. Other people may see him as cruel, but his personal creed is not to kill people needlessly. Even if he would never admit it, Anos is very protective of his fellow subordinates and followers.\r\n\r\nWhile Anos is not inherently evil, his chaotic and sometimes ruthless methods when dealing with his enemies, earned him his title. While he originally never proclaimed himself as the Demon King, he has openly embraced it as the rest of the world views him as such. Those who oppose him, fear his power, and are threatened by the mere fact that a single man possesses such power.\r\n\r\nThe legends of just his gaze striking fear into those who appear before him are not just a rumor either. Just using his demonic eyes to control others\' actions is enough for some to go mentally insane.\r\n\r\n2,000 years ago, in his previous life, Anos was an orphan. Humans killed his mother while she was pregnant with him and he was born from her corpse. He said that it was something he could never forget.\r\n\r\nAs the war between humans and demons raged on, Anos eventually grew tired of the constant fighting and decided that the only way peace could be achieved was by building walls between the four races, hoping they\'d forget their grudge after a thousand years or so. Thus he formed an agreement with the Hero Kanon, Great Spirit Reno, and the God of Creation Militia and sacrificed himself to supply enough magic for the cause, saying that he would reincarnate after 2,000 years.\r\nThe unborn child which Anos would reincarnate into, was close to death while still inside his mother\'s womb. Because the doctors couldn\'t do anything, even with magic, Izabella prayed everyday for her child to be born. It didn\'t matter to her which divine or demonic being answered, so long as they\'d help her child. While she was sleeping, the baby\'s heart stopped inside of her. Izabella prayers were finally answered when the child\'s heart started beating again. Little by little, the unborn child regained his strength and grew as Anos\'s root choose the unborn child to reincarnate in, thus returning life to it.

Which is\r\nwhy Hiratsuka is telling me this. Now that I think of it, Yukinoshita also\r\ndidnt want me to know that the prom was going to be cancelled. I have an\r\nidea of what shes thinking, but perhaps Hiratsuka sensei knows more on the\r\nreason that Yukinoshita is hiding it from me.\r\nBeing unsure of whether Im able to be involved without getting noticed, I\r\nreacted towards the question with a light smile.\r\nThe tight sensation on my rarely used facial muscles tells me that, Im\r\nprobably making a really bitter smile.\r\nTo be honest, theres no doubt that things will only get more and more\r\ntroublesome, just imagining all the directionless talk Ill have with her is\r\nmaking me feel depressed, and what ever conclusion that awaits us wont be\r\nanything good either. Even so, what has been decided has been decided, that I\r\ncant leave this situation alone.

More accurately, it feels like a misunderstanding more than\r\nanything.\"\r\n\"Well, yes...while I dont believe that its codependency, but whats more\r\nimportant is what viewpoint you decide to take. If your feelings are biased\r\ntowards it, then no words will clear that up for you.\"\r\n\"......Yes.\"\r\nI have experienced such stubbornness, more accurately, I once clinged on to\r\nsuch stubbornness.\r\nNo matter how I console myself, its still not easy to give up this life that is as\r\nentangled and blurred like a cotton candy, thousands of carefully fabricated\r\nwords arent enough to cover up this monster of self conscious within me.\r\nWhich is why now, that monster of self consciousness still lurks within me,\r\nstaring from behind.\r\n\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nThis made me realize that, one cant simply brush off how they view\r\nthemselves. I believe that its that same for Yukinoshita. Codependency, no\r\nmatter if it is the truth or not, at least Yukinoshita has bounded herself to\r\nbelieve in such an idea. No matter how hard we try to deny it, she probably\r\nwont believe in us.\r\n\"Haruno isnt completely wrong either. For Yukinoshita, this is an important\r\ntrial that she has to overcome.\"\r\n\"A trial huh...\"\r\nI repeated this term that I rarely hear of, which Hiratsuka nodded in\r\nconfirmation.\r\n\"Well, you can say that this is a ceremony too.\"\r\nShe then lit up another cigarette. Took a deeper breath from it, and exhaled\r\nout a slow thread of smoke.\r\n\"Do you find it ridiculous?\"\r\n\"No, not really......\" I replied while shaking my head: \"this situation does\r\nseems to happen sometimes.\"\r\n\"Well yes, things like this happens all the time.

There will always be that\r\none period where youll have to face yourself honestly.\"\r\nHer view that lands somewhere far outside the window, and her bittersweet\r\ntone made it sound like that she is reminiscing her own past.\r\n\"Has this ever occurred to...you before?\"\r\n\"Yes, of course.\"\r\nShe answered me with a gentle smile, Hiratsuka sensei took another sip of the\r\ncigarette. As she released a short puff of smoke, her iris dilated as if some of\r\n25\r\n\r\n\r\nthe smoke has diffused deep into her lungs.\r\n\"There were a lot of things that I wanted to do in the past. There are also a lot\r\nof things that I cant do, and things I didnt wanted to do. A series of making\r\nchoices, attempting, failing, giving up, and making a new choice, a cycle of\r\nevents that never stops...even till now.\"\r\nHer words swayed lonely in the air along the swaying smoke.\r\nI have no idea what kind of past has she experienced to speak of such things,\r\nbut theyre a proof that the Hiratsuka sensei, this refined woman sitting in\r\nfront of me, is a product of the numerous attempts and challenges she has\r\nfaced.\r\nWe have always sought for definitive proof that we can survive by ourselves,\r\nby gaining confidence, by building results. There wont be anyone who is\r\nwilling to guarantee that for us, even if theres a guarantee, it will only be\r\nmeaningless if we refuse to believe in these guarantees. Which is why we\r\nhave such desires to prove ourselves.\r\nIs it really correct to interfere with Yukinoshitas decision and resolve. I\r\nrecalled this question that Yukinoshita Haruno asked me not long ago.\r\nTo choose, to challenge, to win or lose, these are something that she alone\r\nhas to face. Will she allow anyone else to be involved in it? What identity\r\nand relationship I must have with her to be able to intervene? I have yet to\r\nfind any answers.\r\nHiratsuka tapped on the cigarette a few times to clean off the tobacco ash,\r\nand stared at me behind a veil of white smoke.\r\n\"Let me ask you this one more time, how do you plan to talk to her, really?\"\r\nShe asked about a major issue that Im hesitating with.\r\nShe is certainly looking for my confirmation for one last time.\r\nI started to think carefully about what to say next, as I cant continue to make\r\nany more lies at this moment.\r\n26\r\n\r\n\r\n\"......I dont think that there is an option to not communicate with her.\"\r\nMy answer during the phone call has not changed.\r\nAnd I wont repeat it for a second time, my thoughts and determination are\r\nnot frivolous.\r\nTheres no need for consideration either, I have already made a choice, and\r\nthe conclusion has always been there.\r\nYukinoshitas will has nothing to do with how I should act.\r\nAs it has always been, I do not know any other methods available, the option\r\nI can take has only been that one single option. Attempting any other\r\napproach has never gone well for me. The more I try to avoid making\r\nmistakes the further I stray away from the right path.\r\nWhich is why, Ill use the only method that I have.\r\nIn reply to Hiratsukas serious, intimidating glance, I looked back at her with\r\nmy dead, rotten eyes, refusing to avert my line of view.\r\nHiratsuka sensei then made a satisfied smile.\r\n\"I see.\"\r\nShe gently smiled with her eyes closed. The way she nodded in approval\r\nmade me unsure of how to react.\r\nAs I felt the pressure slowly turning into a gentle sensation, I ended up\r\nloosening my mind to the point of saying unnnecessary things:\r\n\"Wait, I see? Thats it? \"\r\n\"Yes, that shall suffice. I have faith in you Hikigaya.\"\r\nSaid Hiratsuka sensei without any hesitation.\r\n\r\n27\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Uhm, thanks.\"\r\nTo hear her say this in such a direct way that felt like shes stating a simple\r\nfact, I cant even find myself to feel shy about it. I thanked her in a low voice\r\nas I nodded down in order to hide my heating cheeks.\r\nBut it seems that I didnt hide it properly, as I heard her giggling.\r\n\"Listen up Hikigaya, just helping out the prom wont be enough to help her.\r\nYoull have to take proper measures in what methods you use. You already\r\nknew this, didnt you.\"\r\nI nodded.\r\nShe definitely wont accept my offer to help if I dont think of the appropriate\r\nwords to use.\r\nJust making the prom happen wont be enough either. To present\r\nYukinoshitas ability as an individual, to help her become independent is\r\nsomething that needs to be worked on too.\r\nLike the old saying of how teaching someone to fish is better than giving\r\nthem fish. Its better for Yukinoshita to save herself, but I have yet to find a\r\nway to achieve all of these objectives.\r\nIt took me a while to realize that Ive been scratching my head the whole\r\ntime.\r\n\"Its definitely harder than it seemed to be......\"\r\n\"Yes, its hard alright......especially for your kind of situation.\"\r\nHiratsuka took another mouthful of cigarette smoke, and blew out streams of\r\nsmoke from both edges of her mouth.\r\n\"I know right, our relationship only started because one of us needed help\r\nfrom others. And now our wills seem to be clashing with their polar\r\nopposites.\"\r\n\r\n28\r\n\r\n\r\nI then crossed my fingers to form an X shape.\r\nHiratsuka shrugged speechlessly and asked: \"Really now. How do you think\r\nyou guys managed to pull it through before this?\"\r\n\"How did we made it through, huh.....\"\r\nI actually had no idea, all I can remember is me doing things that hardly\r\nmattered in the end.\r\nLooking at my confused expression, Hiratsuka sensei clutched her fists,\r\nwalked towards me and started doing air punches. P...please dont do that,\r\nshes gonna punch me really hard and then treat me very nicely, make me fall\r\nfor her from the treatment contrast, the perfect script to create a masochist, oh\r\ngod......\r\nShe made a victorious smile upon seeing my frightened face.\r\n\"When the ideals of two heroes of justice start to clash, neither of them will\r\nsurrender without a fight.\"\r\nHer dialogue made me feel nostalgic, even if I have forgotten when was the\r\nfirst time I heard of it.\r\n\"Oh......this brings back memories.\"\r\n\"I know right?\"\r\nHiratsuka sensei replied in a joking tone.\r\nBut her smile only lasted for an instant.\r\nThe sides of her mouth are still curving up, but her lonesome eyes started\r\nlooking into the realm of nothingness.\r\n\"This really...brings back a lot of memories...\"\r\nThis dialogue that seemed to come out without her realizing it, is not meant\r\nfor me, but her speaking to herself.\r\n\r\n29\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile I let Hiratsuka to have her own moment, I turned my neck left and\r\nright to relax my head a bit. Even if we both felt nostalgic, her current\r\nfeelings are contextually different from mine, so I kept quiet.\r\nThe silence however didnt last long, as Hiratsuka sensei continued speaking:\r\n\"Its not the first day you two have different opinions isnt it? But you all\r\nmanaged to overcome such situations, to have faith in what you have gained\r\nfrom those past experiences, is my suggestion to you.\"\r\n\"Yeah...Ill try.\" I replied her with a gentle smile.\r\nShe does not wish to be assisted, but I cant avoid communicating with her\r\neither. Which is why a new way of communication has to be sought.\r\nReviewing my past experiences gave me a vague yet solid answer.\r\nSeeing me nodding in enlightenment, Hiratsuka smiled in satisfaction:\r\n\"Now that you came up with a clearer guideline, I think its time to go meet up\r\nwith her, Yukinoshita should still be in the student council room right now,\r\ngo.\"\r\n\"Yes, Ill be leaving th...wait, one last thing I wanted to ask you.\"\r\nAs I was about to stand up, I remembered of something that I was curious of\r\nsince the beginning of the conversation.\r\n\"Hmm?\"\r\nHiratsuka sensei tilted her head, and made a childish smile that hardly fits her\r\ncurrent age. My expression Im having right now seemed more sinister in\r\ncomparison:\r\n\"So in the end of the day, the proms organizers only need to perform self\r\nrestraint , isnt it?\"\r\n\"...I was asked with the same question not long ago.\"\r\nThe way Hiratsuka said it tells me that, Yukinoshita and the others have no\r\n\r\n30\r\n\r\n\r\nintent to give up on the graduation prom. In fact , they already came up with\r\nthis conclusion right before me.\r\nHiratsuka sensei closed her eyes, and then let up a deep sigh as if she gave up\r\nstruggling. Took another mouthful of smoke, and then released them as she\r\nlooked towards a distant place within the scenery outside.\r\nI know that her actions indicate that she has acquiesced with our ideas. While\r\nI felt grateful to Hiratsuka sensei, it also left me worried about the\r\nconsequences.\r\n\"But if we continued doing this, wouldnt it put you in a very risky situation?\"\r\nIf unwanted events occurred during the process, shell have to take full\r\nresponsibility for our mess. Im not sure what kind of punishment the school\r\nauthorities will impose onto her, but shell definitely end up being judged by\r\nboth concerned and unconcerned parties. Lynches that goes with the name of\r\nsocial justice are pretty common after all.\r\nBut Hiratsuka sensei simply shrugged, and said with a playful tone:\r\n\"By the time anything happens I wont be around anyways, I dont care about\r\nwhat happens after Im gone.\"\r\n\"Ahaha, said it like a typical modern youngster.\"\r\n\"Of course, I am a modern youngster after all.\"\r\nIn protest to my comment. She tapped on the table for a times as she adjusted\r\nher tone to sound like a youngster. Her joke made me start to laugh out of\r\ncontrol.\r\n\"Even if things did came down to the worst, Im only gonna lose my job. Its\r\nno big deal, just do whatever you want.\"\r\nHiratsuka continued to joke around, tapping her throat with a handknife.\r\n\"Eh......nah I cant just do that....\"\r\n\r\n31\r\n\r\n\r\nDont just bet your career over it. This pressures me so hard, that my lifespan\r\nis shortening like mad girl.\r\n\"Dont mind me, its just a joke. My wits are stronger than you thing, if I\r\nreally lost my job, Im just gonna get married, if I find one whos willing to,\r\nthat is.\"\r\nHer fingers slides across her hair, as she starts to laughs ironically.\r\nI cant get myself to laugh over this matter, yet I ended up laughing softly and\r\nsaid:\r\n\"Youll be fine.\"\r\n\"What, you plan to marry me someday?\"\r\nHiratsuka reacted almost instantaneously with a shocked face. Wait what no?\r\nShes too precious for me to own! So someone please, before I change my\r\nmind, please marry her now!\r\nAs I was thinking on how to reply her, she stared at me with her big round\r\neyes like an abandoned labrador. Ah, large canines are just so cute......but\r\nwait, I already have a cat in my house. So I shook my head in embarassment.\r\n\"Actually I dont have plans to deal with the situation with chaotic\r\nmethods......I think.\"\r\nI said it without sounding too confident.\r\nWere in a really unfavorable situation. Trying to achieve a mutual agreement\r\nwith Yukinoshita is going to be a challenge too.\r\nBut even if Im aware that we havent obtained the win condition, I still have\r\nto sound optimistic, or else Doraemon cant go back to the future in peace...\r\nI tried to smile as much as possible to cover up my facade. And so, Hiratsuka\r\nstared at me silently.\r\n\"......So reliable.\"\r\n\r\n32\r\n\r\n\r\nLike a person watching a car leaving into the distance, she closed her eyes\r\nslowly, and said it in a gentle voice.\r\nHearing that made me blush for a moment, without realizing it, I tured my\r\nhead away while touching my hair.\r\nI made big words that hardly suits someone of my identity.\r\nBeing aware that I should also make sure that my methods wont cause\r\nHiratsuka sensei to be affected to its consequences, the difficulty of the\r\nsituation seemed to has increase a little more than the hard mode it already is.\r\nEven so, this made me sense a glimpse of light within the situation.\r\nIf the process is handled properly, there wont be any situation where\r\nHiratsuka sensei will have to take responsibility for us. Well yeah, probably,\r\nit better be.\r\nSigh, but then again I should really prepare myself to explain to my parents,\r\non why would I marry a woman whos about ten years older than me.\r\nAnyway, now that my course of action has been decided. Since theres\r\nnothing more for us to speak of. The both of us remained silent.\r\nWithin the few seconds of silence, I swallowed down the rest of the sweet\r\ncoffee, and stood up getting ready to leave. Picked up my school bag and coat\r\nthat was put aside, leaving everything else in the room.\r\n\"Im going.\"\r\n\"Umu.\"\r\nI made a short goodbye, which she replied with a nod.\r\nOur chat has now come to an end, on the timing that I think is most\r\nappropriate.\r\nBut just as I was about to walk out of the room, I heard her voice coming\r\nfrom behind:\r\n\r\n33\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Hikigaya.\"\r\nI did not look back, but I dont plan on ignoring her call either, so I halted.\r\n\"Im sorry......that I cant bring myself to say it.\"\r\nIm unable to see Hiratsuka senseis expression at this moment, yet its not\r\nhard to imagine the way shes looking onto the floor sadly, because its the\r\nsame expression Im having right now.\r\nAs I tried to say something, the bitterness of the coffee that shouldve been\r\ncompletely swallowed rose back up, and my throat is blocked by the strong\r\nscent of condensed milk.\r\nI reacted by forcing the coffee back into my stomach, along with the words\r\nthat I wanted to say.\r\n\"Cough....no, you dont have to apologize.\"\r\nTurned my head over my shoulders, and with the properly prepared smiling\r\nface, I continued saying:\r\n\"Theres nothing that we can do about, thats just how jobs work. I understand\r\nthat your position doesnt allow you to talk about it. And its not like your\r\ntransfer has been decided yet right?\"\r\nI tried to say it in the most fluent and natural way possible. But Hikagaya\r\nHachiman was never a bright cheerful person to begin with, which made it\r\nsound blank and insincere instead.\r\nHiratsuka sensei acted as if she isnt bothered by it, and continued to say\r\nwhile looking down.\r\n\"Well yeah, the official dismissal letter havent been given yet.\"\r\nTo not speak about things that havent been officially announced. This is a\r\nrule that comes along with the job position.\r\nBut deep down, were both aware that this is merely an excuse. Yet this is an\r\n\r\n34\r\n\r\n\r\nactual existing rule that must not be broken.\r\nWhich is why we decided to accept and compromise. No malicious or\r\nvirtuous will exists behind her decision, she is simply complying with the\r\nrules. Because were aware of such a rule, there is nothing that we can do\r\nabout it, except for accepting it with a smile.\r\n\"But its gonna be really embarrassing if I dont have to leave in the end.\r\nAhahaha....\"\r\nSaid Hiratsuka sensei as she followed with a laugh while stroking her hair.\r\n\"Isnt that so? Hahaha...\"\r\nI laughed too, and I started to feel a little more relaxed.\r\nBut that couldnt make the emptiness to leave me.\r\nI am well aware of it.\r\nMaking jokes wont change anything, in fact the act of joking itself will\r\neventually turn stale, and verbal conversation can only serve to disguise\r\nourselves.\r\nBut all things will come to an end eventually.\r\nOur conversation has came to an end too.\r\n\"Im going, then.\"\r\n\"Yes, do your best.\"\r\nI took a slight bow, as I walked out of the room, the flickering sounds of a\r\nflame being lit up could be heard from behind.\r\nAlong with a short sigh.\r\nHiratsuka sensei will be working in the staff room for another while, I guess.\r\n\r\n35\r\n\r\n\r\nI then closed the door to the staff room.\r\n\r\n36\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 2: Insistingly, Isshiki Iroha\r\nHas Something to Confirm\r\nThe windows aside were dyed with the colors of the sunset.\r\nA dark blue presence slowly stretched itself from the other side of the sky,\r\nthe flickering road lamps illuminates the path for the leaving students.\r\nEven though the length of daylight has slightly extended, night still seems to\r\nhave fallen rather early. The total silence from the soccer field where most\r\nsports club operate on tells me that the school gates will soon close.\r\nThe time spent in the staff room wasnt too long, but enough to change the\r\nscenery within the campus. As if we have lost our sense of time within that\r\nsmall isolated space.\r\nWithin that tiny gap of time where I looked away from the windows, things\r\ncontinued to change.\r\nEven by now, as I walk on this short path that leads me from staff room to the\r\nstudent council room, new circumstances might have arose without me\r\nrealizing it.\r\nBeing aware of the changes that could happen in any minute, I made haste on\r\nmy footsteps.\r\nThis passageway with no presence of anyone other than myself, is filled up\r\nby the sunsets afterglow.\r\nIn comparison to the special block or new school building that has better\r\nlighting, the transparent windows being the only light source here gives off a\r\nmore chilling sensation, while during winter things would look much more\r\n\r\n37\r\n\r\n\r\ncolder in this corridor.\r\nThe sounds of footsteps echoed within the chilly air.\r\nNot the lively flapping kind of footsteps, nor the bold heavy kind of\r\nfootsteps, but mushy sounds of footsteps that gave off a sense of wetness.\r\nAs Im in a hurry, I walked in an awkward way, where I can feel one my\r\nshoes stepping on the heel of the other at times.\r\nBut I cant stop just yet.\r\nNot stopping is already a big improvement by itself.\r\nMy body felt lighter after the talk with Hiratsuka sensei.\r\nI now have a clear image of the things that I want to do, the things that I wish\r\nto own.\r\nIgnore anything unnecessary, throw away the questions accumulated in my\r\nmind, stop thinking about those concerns that loomed in my heart.\r\nLeave everything else behind, keeping only the mission, and work on it like a\r\nrobot.\r\nAs long as this can be solved, its fine to shove everything else aside, what I\r\nmust do now, is to seek for every single option that I could make use of.\r\nAs I kept walking, I have reached the very end of the afterglow in the\r\npassageway.\r\nThe seemingly continuous flow of windows were replaced by the walls that\r\nlinks to the student council room.\r\nThe door to the student council room was closed shut, and no voices were\r\nheard from the inside, making my own breathing the only sound audible to\r\nme. I took some time to regulate my breath in order to calm myself down.\r\nIt has been a few days since Ive ever met Yukinoshita and Iroha, the last time\r\n\r\n38\r\n\r\n\r\nwe met, is the day when Yukinoshitas mother came over to the school to\r\nrequest for the cancellation of the prom. Our last conversation being a refusal\r\nthat hardly counts as a proper talk.\r\nWhich is why staying calm and composed is crucial to what happens next. If\r\nany one of us have our feelings take over ourselves, it will be impossible for\r\nus to reach a common ground.\r\nAlright, this shouldnt be that big of a problem, after all my emotions have\r\ndied off to the point that it has reached a negative value! But wait, isnt that\r\nworse?\r\nCan I do it? Can I do it? (Heartbeat rises)...Ah yes, ah yes, I can do it I can do\r\nit, gambatei~gambatei <3\r\nThis extremely out of character encouragement I made to myself had a\r\nsurprisingly uplifting effect on my mood, thus I took advantage this change,\r\nand knocked on the door.\r\n\"Coming~\"\r\nIrohas voice and sounds of approaching footsteps could be heard.\r\nThe door soon opened up, as I looked into the door seam, her flaxen brown\r\ncolored hair could be seen swaying around, along her long woolen sweater\r\nthat shone under the sunset.\r\nIsshiki Irohas head then popped out from the half opened door, and soon as\r\nshe saw me, her expression turned from her originally cute curious face into\r\na...face that spells of yabai desu.\r\n\"...Ah.\"\r\nIroha took a soft sigh, took a glance behind her, and walked out of the student\r\ncouncil room cautiously, and closed the door immediately as she stepped out.\r\nLooking at me we an awkward expression:\r\n\"So you came after all...ahaha.\"\r\n\r\n39\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, is Yukinoshita in there?\"\r\nIroha looked back at the student council room as she heard my question,\r\nimplying that Yukinoshita is indeed in the room, I then exhaled out gases of\r\nrelief and nervousness.\r\nI grabbed onto my pockets to wipe off the sweat on my palm, then moved\r\nforward, reaching out my arm towards the doorknob.\r\nAs I was about to reach it, Iroha moved left to block my arm. Whats this? A\r\ncrab game? Guess the Obamasgone meme even got to the masses huh. I then\r\nsent out my left hand, which Iroha reacted swiftly, blocking all possible paths\r\nI could reach out to the doorknob. Whats with this one on one defense\r\nsituation, our national team really need someone of your caliber on their\r\ndefensive line...\r\n\"Uhm......youre blocking the way...can you uh, move aside please?\"\r\nIroha answered by completely sticking her back onto the doorknob, crossed\r\nher arms, stared at me and said:\r\n\"Before that, may I know for what exact reason are you here? Unrelated\r\npersonnel are prohibited in this room, you know.\"\r\nIroha wagged her finger while saying this with a stern face, huh, a never seen\r\nbefore expression from her. Thanks to the special treatment from both ex and\r\npresent student council president , Ive always entered this room without\r\nasking permission, but it is a rule that unrelated personnel are prohibited from\r\nthe student council room. And now that this rule has been brought up against\r\nme, I cant do anything about it either.\r\nSigh, for a girl of Irohas personality this is just so annoying, but then\r\nagain...the way she put one hand on her waist, while waggling her finger on\r\nthe other looks so cute, not to mention that shes pouting too.\r\nBut in contrast to her cute expression, from how she refused to move away\r\nfrom the door, I can sense a strong will that wont yield unless I convince her\r\nproperly, so Ill have to be honest with Iroha or she wont budge.\r\n\r\n40\r\n','Oregairu Vol 13 - part 2.txt','uploaded/doc/Oregairu Vol 13 - part 2.txt','uploaded/img/677308.jpg.jpeg','Since every group have a set of their own rules, one has to carefully observe\nthese signals, go along the flow, and get used to these rules\n',3816,'2020-11-15 18:26:05','2020-11-15 18:26:05'),(13,'Oregairu Vol. 13 Ch.3','Volume 13 starts with Hachiman arriving at the staff room to talk with Hiratsuka','\"...Im here to help.\"\r\n\"You cant <3 \"\r\n\"Eh......\"\r\nIroha then moved closer to me and lay out her arms horizontally, as if she is\r\nblocking me while asserting her dominance.\r\nBut she seemed to realize that I have no intention to leave either, probably\r\nknowing this situation will probably last very long without any of us giving\r\nup, Iroha then asked:\r\n\"So...you already knew about the current situation of the prom?\"\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\nAs she heard my answer, Iroha then knocked on her head with a troubled\r\nface. After a few moments of silence, she looked back at the room again. She\r\nthen took a few steps away from the room, while signaling me to follow her.\r\nIt seems that she doesnt want our conversation to be overheard by\r\nYukinoshita, at least that seems to be her intention.\r\nOr I can just ignore her and go straight into the room instead.\r\nAs I sneaked bit by bit towards the door, Iroha who already expected me to\r\ndo so, grabbed onto my cuffs, and dragged me far far away from the room.\r\nSince I cant just shake off her small hands, I had no choice but to follow\r\nIrohas lead, after walking a distance in the corridor, we took a turn, and\r\nstopped at the open corridor that links the main school building to the special\r\nblock.\r\nA long bench was placed at the walls of this air corridor, students tend to\r\ngather around here in between classes, but now that its late, the only things\r\nhere are the chilly air that fills in the atmosphere and the dim light from the\r\nsunset.\r\nAfter walking to the bench, Iroha finally let go of me, I rubbed on the cuff of\r\n41\r\n\r\n\r\nmy sleeve to make sure that there are no wrinkles, a lingering warmth could\r\nfelt as I touched it, which made my cheeks tickle a little. Geez dont just hold\r\nonto my sleeves all of a sudden, this makes me feel shy you know.\r\n\"Senpai, I appreciate your intention to help, I personally feel happy about it\r\ntoo but...\"\r\nAs Iroha made a pause while leaning her back onto the window, she\r\nawkwardly looked to the ground, along that long eyelashes of hers.\r\n\"But I cant let you in just yet, more specifically I cant let you meet her.\"\r\n\"Why?\"\r\nI asked while sitting onto the bench. Iroha lay down her hands and put it\r\nbehind her, sticking onto the windows.\r\n\"To be honest I was thinking that things will get more troublesome if senpai\r\ncame over immediately, so maybe its better if you could come over a bit\r\nmore later.\"\r\n\"Well... yes, maybe youre right.\"\r\nIts not hard to figure out where she is coming from, since Iroha was there\r\nwhen we had that argument. It makes sense for her to be worried, especially\r\nafter witnessing such a pointless dispute. I felt anxious about meeting up with\r\nYukinoshita too, but even so, I cant just take a step backwards.\r\n\"...Its fine, I plan to speak to her properly.\"\r\n\"I P L A N T O S P E A K T O H E R P R O P E R L Y. Eh~~ you sure\r\nabout that senpai?\"\r\nShe stared at me in a very doubtful way...the edges of her lips were twisting\r\nas if its making a ngyeh sound, her eyebrows look tightly wrinkled too.\r\nWhats with this level of disbelief...her expression made me feel uneasy, so I\r\nslowly averted my eyes, and made a soft cough.\r\n\"Its true, its true all right? I did make a proper planning on how to startup the\r\n42\r\n\r\n\r\nconversation.\"\r\nBringing up codependency will only stress us off. So for now its better to\r\navoid dealing with this matter, and work on the other important issues. Our\r\nthoughts might differ, but we have the common topic of making the prom a\r\nsuccess, and that should allow us to have a constructive discussion.\r\nBut man, why is Iroha still putting up that doubtful face...\r\n\"How to start up the conversation huh...cant say that I trust senpai on that.\"\r\n\"Yeah, sure sucks to have low credibility.\"\r\nBeing self aware of my life decisions that hardly earned me any credibility, I\r\nshrugged lightly.\r\nIroha then stood silent for a moment as if shes trying to observe something,\r\nand let out a deep sigh. Guess shes just felt speechless towards me.\r\n\"Senpai, youre being overprotective again.\"\r\nAs Iroha said so, she walked towards me, gripped onto the edges of her skirt,\r\nand gently sat beside me. She held onto her forehead, slightly lifting her chin.\r\nHer hair rustled lightly as they moved across her elbows, glimmering under\r\nthe sunset, she started to gaze at somewhere beyond the windows in front of\r\nus.\r\n\"Im sure that, Yukinoshita senpai is trying her best here. Not that I cant\r\nunderstand how she felt.\"\r\n\"...Well, she definitely is.\"\r\nI lay down my hands behind me, and stared at the ceiling above.\r\nPerhaps Irohas respond is a better idea. When someone has the intent to\r\ncomplete something alone, for the others to take a step back and see things\r\nthrough is probably whats better for that person\r\n\"Even so...you still plan to help her?\"\r\n\r\n43\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking towards the direction of her voice, Irohas hand continued to lay on\r\nher forehead, while slightly turning her head towards me, as if shes\r\nobserving my reactions. Even if this action felt pretty childish, very cute, but\r\na chilling sense of seriousness lies within her eyes.\r\n\"...That is my intention.\"\r\nWhile I cant trust my dead fish eyeballs to make me look serious at all, I\r\ntried to compensate by deepening my tone. Iroha stayed silent for a while,\r\nseemingly considering something, then asked me in a soft tone:\r\n\"Even if...doing so wouldnt benefit Yukinoshita senpai at all, youll still offer\r\nyour aid?\r\n\"I never really acted out on the intent of benefiting anyone in the first place,\r\nso Im just doing the usual here...yeah.\"\r\n\"Doing the usual...huh.\"\r\nI nodded in reply as she muttered those words in a confused tone. Iroha then\r\nlaid her head down, while I turned my head to look at the windows\r\nThe outcomes have always been the same.\r\nMy words and actions have always end up being far from the correct\r\nsolution. An endless cycle of misunderstanding things and making mistakes,\r\neven my apology didnt end up well, like a row of buttons that continue to\r\nend up in the wrong hole of the shirt.\r\nThis has been repeating throughout the whole year, and before I realize it,\r\nwinter is almost over, the strong winds that indicates the incoming of spring\r\nrattles the windows, breaking this short moment of silence.\r\n\"To be honest, I dont think that Yukinoshita senpai will accept your offer.\"\r\n\"Indeed...\"\r\nI accidentally let out a deep sigh, Iroha then came closer and continued\r\nsaying:\r\n44\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In fact, youll probably be cruelly rejected.\"\r\n\"Thats probably the case...\"\r\nI sighed once again, Iroha moved even closer and stared at me:\r\n\"Even so, you still want to help?\"\r\n\"Of course Ill help...\"\r\nHearing my answer that was followed up by another sigh, Iroha opened her\r\nmouth wide while leaning her head to her right:\r\n\"Huh!? But why bruh?\"\r\n\"Well for why Im doing so...\"\r\nIs it really that shocking, she even stopped using honorifics at this point, not\r\nthat it really matters...But, did she forgot what she said in the first place...\r\n\"Werent you the one who asked for my help in the first place...\"\r\nAs I said that, Iroha looks frozen for a moment, blinked her eyes for a few\r\ntimes. Then took a quick step back, and then shook her hands, while saying\r\nrapidly:\r\n\"Wha...what? Are you doing it for me?! What the hell do you have a crush on\r\nme or something even though I have always received your help even though\r\nyou always treated me nicely and even though I dont dislike you but there\r\nare too many things that need to be cleared up for now so lets put this off for\r\nanother time sorrymasen.\"\r\nShe quickly followed up with a deep bow. Which I responded by nodding my\r\nhead in satisfaction.\r\n\"Ah yes, now thats what Im looking for. It sounds different from the usual\r\nbut whatever.\"\r\n\"Whats with this comment...its the same as the usual isnt it?\"\r\n\r\n45\r\n\r\n\r\nMuttered Iroha unhappily, she seems to have glared at me too. Yeah\r\nwhatever, thats the reaction I expected...taking a distance away from me as I\r\nlie down feeling exhausted, Iroha pointed at her cheeks with her index finger,\r\nwhile saying with a poker face.\r\n\"I wont mind if you use me as an excuse, though.\"\r\n\"Bad excuse, and its not the real reason after all...\"\r\nIroha ignored my correction, and continued poking her cheek, looking\r\ntroubled:\r\n\"But to be fair, I doubt that wouldnt be the kind of reason Yukinoshita senpai\r\nwill accept either.\"\r\n\"Of course its not...how did we loop back to this? But hey, at least our great\r\nIrohasu can help by saying a few goods throughout our conversation, no?\"\r\n\"Eh...I dont want to... Also it impossible for me to do so.\"\r\n\"Impossible... Even answering that in an instant...\"\r\nWait, did she seriously just said I dont want to? As I looked towards her,\r\nwondering if I misheard Mada Mada for Yada Yada, Iroha made a soft\r\ncough, then patted on her chest for no reason and said:\r\n\"Yes, a girls decision cannot be easily be changed. Well, but if its something\r\ndecided by someone else we can simply make amends to it, if that decision is\r\na pain we can act like we forgotten it.\"\r\n\"Youre the worst...\"\r\nNonono, thats just you isnt it? Its not a girls exclusive thing, but varies from\r\none to another. The kind of equality where everyone can be All Might is\r\nsomething that a person without talents like me believes in.\r\nAs she turned back towards me, Iroha said with a worried face.\r\n\"And considering that its Yukinoshita senpai were dealing with here, its\r\n\r\n46\r\n\r\n\r\ngoing to be hard isnt it...\"\r\n\"Of course, of course it would be...\"\r\nNot because its a girls decision, but Yukinoshitas decision, a decision that I\r\ncant go against easily. Looking back at my year long experiences of\r\ninteracting with her, its obvious that Yukinoshitas honesty and seriousness\r\nwont allow her to take back those words that easily.\r\nShutting her eyes closed, crossing her arms, Iroha made a short groan and\r\nsaid.\r\n\"For this time, I can feel that she has been caring for me a lot...so I felt like\r\nsupporting her decision too.\"\r\nShe then stated her final stand with a bitter smile:\r\n\"Which is why, I cant bring myself to help out in persuading her, Im sorry\r\nsenpai.\"\r\nI told her not to worry while making my best smile possible, which she\r\nreplied with a gentle nod. For my random idea of her saying some good\r\nthings to Yukinoshita, she listened properly and even considered things\r\nthoroughly. I have to say, Isshiki Iroha really is a much decent person than\r\nhow I used to judge her. Which made me feel sorry for attempting to drag her\r\ninto such a messy issue.\r\nYes, I should be the one to do the planning.\r\n...Now then, how should I tell her exactly? I cant figure it out, she is truly a\r\nbig trouble, that girl...but when it comes to being a troublesome Im the same\r\nas her, perhaps even more troublesome in comparison.\r\nI started to rub on my forehead to have a better blood flow around my brain,\r\nwhile doing so, Iroha kept staring at me without making a sound.\r\n\"......\"\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n47\r\n\r\n\r\nI asked as I realize her view focusing on me, she shook her head and\r\nanswered.\r\n\"Not really, I was just thinking on how persistent you are.\"\r\n\"Ah...well yes.\"\r\nTo hear such a direct comment, while being stared by her, I find myself in a\r\nlack myself of words. Thus I could only reply in such a short, incomplete\r\nmanner. Iroha slowly walked near me until reaching an arms distance, while\r\ncontinuing to look into my eyes.\r\n\"But why? Being rejected by Yukinoshita senpai by herself, and after hearing\r\nsuch words from Haruno senpai. For what exact reason are you pushing\r\nyourself this much? When it comes to such a sticky situation one would\r\nsimply stay away as far as possible, isnt it so.\"\r\nShe phrased her question in a way that doesnt allow me a chance to answer.\r\nEven if I could, I doubt that I can come out with a proper answer.\r\nIroha steps closer every time she asks a question, while I move back to\r\nmaintain our distance, to the point I could feel the back of my legs pressing\r\nitself onto the bench.\r\n\"Theres a lot of reasons behind it...\"\r\nRealizing that there is no further space for me to move away, I could only\r\navoid looking directly at her, but Iroha proceeded to grab onto my tie.\r\n\"Please answer me seriously, senpai.\"\r\nIroha forcefully re turned my head towards her, the obvious twist on my\r\nnecktie tells me that shes applying a lot of strength onto it.\r\nIm unable to look away, neither could I avert my line of view from the image\r\nof Irohas soft lips and glowing eyes. In front of her determined expression, I\r\ncould only do my best to open my heavy mouth.\r\n\"I swear, there really are a lot of reasons behind it, its impossible to state each\r\n48\r\n\r\n\r\nof them clearly just yet...\"\r\n\"Its fine even if you said it vaguely.\"\r\nIroha does not give any room for me to play around with words, removing all\r\nchances for me to remain silent.\r\nBut how exactly should I phrase it to make her understand better.\r\nThese painful feelings are not something that could be simply expressed\r\nthrough words, but whats more troublesome about them is that they could be\r\ndescribed and be interpreted as anything within the acceptable range. Such a\r\ntranslucent, unclear, shapeless thing. To apply existing words onto it will\r\nonly slowly chip it off from the sides to the point it reaches degradation,\r\nending up as a total mistake.\r\nMore importantly, I could not accept the act of simplifying things into one\r\nsingle sentence.\r\nUp until now, Ive always relied on excuses like bringing my sister into the\r\npicture, or stating that Im just doing my job. Even just now, I tried using\r\nIrohas request as an excuse, something that she would usually get along with.\r\nBut what Iroha Isshiki wanted is not such dishonest words. Her eyes keep\r\ntelling me that,\r\nit doesnt need to come with a motive, it doesnt need a proper elaboration,\r\nits fine for me to make it unclear, its fine for me to say it vaguely.\r\nShow me your answer.\r\n\"......I have a responsibility.\"\r\n\"Responsibility, huh.\"\r\nMuttered Iroha in a low voice, she took a short breath, and slightly inclined\r\nher head.\r\n\r\n49\r\n\r\n\r\nDid it sound too confusing to her? She lowered her head and seemingly\r\nthought for a while, then looked back up, signaling me to continue.\r\nI nodded in reply, and started assembling words in my head. Probably\r\nbecause Iroha is grabbing onto it, my slightly loose necktie now felt very\r\ntight, I find it hard to breath, and my chest felt unusually hot.\r\n\"For things to become so complicated, and reaching such a state of\r\ncodependency, its safe to say that I am responsible for causing all of these.\r\nWhich is why I wanted to clean up my own mess, not a decision to change\r\nthings up, but simply how I have always done it. Thats all that there is.\" as I\r\nfinally said out my conclusion that sounded like an answer, Irohas hand let\r\ngo of my necktie, and slipped down as it loses its strength.\r\n\"Ahaha...my bad, it sounded so different what my expectations, that I spaced\r\nout a bit right there. Ah...your necktie is completely messed up too, Im really\r\nsorry.\"\r\n\"Ah, dont mind, it was kinda twisted before you grabbed on it anyway...\"\r\nEven after hearing that, Iroha seemed to think that she shouldnt have done\r\nthat, muttering words like yabai desu, while anxiously rubbing my necktie\r\nwith her hands, attempting to straighten it. She rubbed on it so hard, that my\r\nbody wobbled along her movements.\r\nHer hands stopped all of a sudden.\r\n\"Those words that you said just now, can you properly tell the same to\r\nYukinoshita senpai?\"\r\nIrohas eyes are still focused onto my necktie, making a weird expression that\r\nI cant identify.\r\nI couldnt answer her in time, so Iroha pressed on my necktie again, urging\r\nme for an answer. Her flaxen brown started to rustle as if theyre teasing me.\r\nHer cute expression that seemed like she was joking gave me a peace of\r\nmind, which made me smile before I realized it.\r\n\r\n50\r\n\r\n\r\n\".....Ill definitely say it, but the real question here is whether these words can\r\nreach her.\"\r\n\"Hmph, truly a troublesome bunch of senpais.\"\r\nIroha looked up with a speechless kind of smile, and then slapped on my\r\nnecktie.\r\n\"For me as long as the Service Club would help me out then there will always\r\nbe less things to worry of. So go for it alright.\"\r\nIroha swiftly stood up, after taking a few steps, she turned back at me, and\r\nwaved in a way that signals me to follow her. Guess she finally allowed me\r\nto enter the student council room.\r\nI lifted up my stiff body, and walked towards her.\r\n\r\n51\r\n\r\n\r\n2-2\r\nAs I entered the student council room alongside Iroha, a fragrant scent could\r\nbe smelled, which seems to be some kind of indoor perfume. Unlike the one\r\nwe have in the Service Club room, its a more refreshingly sweet fruity smell,\r\nwithout the clear fragrance of tea within in.\r\nThe student council room isnt really big, and the stacking piles of items\r\nwithin the room shows a sign of its long history. In the center of all this mess\r\nis a small space that looks unusually tidy and clean.\r\nBeside the poignantly designed chairman table places a simple work desk,\r\nwhere Yukinoshita is standing behind it, while looking at a white board.\r\nConsidering that no other student council members are in here, Yukinoshita\r\nand Iroha probably stayed here by themselves to discuss on a new course of\r\nplan. Words in red blue and black could be seen on the whiteboard, as she\r\nnotices someone else entering, Yukinoshita turned her head over.\r\n\"Oh, Hikigaya kun.\"\r\n\"Sup.\"\r\nYukinoshita acted naturally even after seeing me, showing a faint smile, as if\r\nshe wasnt affected emotionally by the self restraining order.\r\n\"Isshiki san, lets have a short break shall we.\"\r\nSaying that, she unlocked the fixating valve on the white board, flipped the\r\nboard around to show its other surface, and pushed it aside.\r\nYukinoshita proceeded to prepare tea, she turned on the electric kettle in this\r\nroom, and took out tea bags while waiting for the water to boil.\r\nLooking at her doing these actions in a skillful manner, I felt reminiscent all\r\nof a sudden. As she realizes my sights laying on her,\r\n52\r\n\r\n\r\nYukinoshita shifted her eyes, and stopped at a chair in front of her desk,\r\nsignaling me to take a seat.\r\nThe popping sounds of water boiling can be heard as I pulled the chair to\r\nmake space. Iroha then walked lively towards the chairman desk, sitting on a\r\nluxurious looking armchair. I mean that chair is cool looking and all, BUT\r\nCAN YOU DO THIS!? Only 399 by the way. (Im doing my part Pewds)\r\nSoon, Yukinoshita pushed over a cup that looks different from our usual tea\r\nset. As I thanked her, I held up the cup of tea, only to smell an unfamiliar\r\nscent.\r\n\"Have you heard of it?\"\r\nShe asked an unspecific question, but its obvious on what topic are we\r\ntalking about here.\r\n\"Ah, yes. Since I was beside Yuigahama just now.\"\r\nYukinoshita seemed surprised for a second, but quickly went back to her\r\ncalm expression from before.\r\n\"...I see.\"\r\n\"I already talked to Hiratsuka sensei to learn about the details. Is it fine on\r\nyour side? I can help if theres anything that requires my assistance...\"\r\nAs I was halfway through my sentence, Yukinoshita brought the paper cup\r\nnear to her mouth, took a light sip of tea to moisturize her mouth and\r\nanswered:\r\n\"There is no need for that, as were already working on the appropriate\r\ncountermeasures.\"\r\nComparing to the warmth from the cup of tea in my hands, our conversation\r\nseemed to have started in a cold awkward tone. Being uneasy of such an\r\n\r\n53\r\n\r\n\r\natmosphere, Iroha made a few twists on her body, while glancing towards\r\nme, telling me to \"please say it nicely\".\r\nNo wait a second Iroha, for a conversation to work, stuff like directions,\r\nsequences, procedures and timing, even bravery are all relevant essentials\r\nisnt it? Man, it just feel so difficult to make a proper conversation. Even now,\r\nmy attempt to make a test on her intention to talk about this topic got shut\r\ndown immediately.\r\nAnyway for the conversation to continue, an appropriate head start is\r\nrequired, which isnt really something Im used to.\r\nI made a few blows over my cup of tea, thinking on how should I start the\r\nconversation. Soon after the hot sensation starts to fade away from the tea,\r\nreaching a temperature where my cat tongue can take it in, I took a sip of the\r\ntea, and asked with a soft voice.\r\n\"So... whats your plan?\"\r\nUpon hearing my question, Yukinoshita looked into my eyes, as if shes\r\ntrying to instigate something out of me.\r\n\"Were still reviewing our existing proposal, for now theres nothing much to\r\nsay about our plans.\"\r\nReviewing, huh...But considering all those words that I saw on the\r\nwhiteboard just now, and Iroha glancing towards Yukinoshita with a weird\r\nlook, it seems that the main direction theyll be taking has already been\r\ndecided, but she didnt want to talk about it.\r\nShe even flipped the whiteboard around so that no one could see it, perhaps\r\nforcing an answer is not the best course of action.\r\nIn that case, its better to talk in a more roundabout way, since the\r\nconversation will continue to be derailed with my current method. I looked\r\ntowards Iroha and asked.\r\n\r\n54\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Is there anything to do right now?\"\r\n\"...For now, nothing much.\"\r\nIroha looked away while answering, but she didnt look towards Yukinoshita\r\neither, so its hard to say whether this is a lie or not.\r\nBut looking at the absence of the other student council committees, and the\r\nlax atmosphere within this room. It does seems that the situation wasnt as\r\nurgent as it seems to be, at least theres no specific action that has to be done\r\nimmediately.\r\n\"So to put it in other words, right now is not the suitable time to execute\r\nimmediate actions?\"\r\n\"Of course, after all we only received the self restrain order by today.\"\r\nYukinoshita replied the conclusion that I muttered out accidentally, with the\r\nsame calm tone. For someone who just received the notice not long ago, her\r\nwords lack a sense of anxiety one would usually expect. Most probably she\r\ntoo, has already noticed the other meaning behind apply self restrain, which\r\nis why she can remain her composure right now.\r\nFor the self restraining order from the schools executives, me and\r\nYukinoshita share a similar view on the schools intent. A common topic is\r\nthe spice to inducing an active conversation, I can probably touch on this\r\ntopic a little more.\r\nI looked back at Yukinoshita.\r\n\"But there are countermeasures that can be designed based on that isnt so.\r\nAfter all it is only a restraining order, in fact straight out ignoring such an\r\norder is possible in case youre desperate.\"\r\nThe ones who gave out the restraining order are the school executives,\r\nspecifically a concession they made towards Hiratsuka sensei. To request for\r\nsomeone to apply self restrain, it also means handing over the right of action\r\n\r\n55\r\n\r\n\r\nto its subject, a wording that could be portrayed in a way where its subject is\r\nallowed to make their decisions based on their own judgement. While its\r\noriginal intent is to request the prom organizers to cancel the event without\r\nthem sounding to be forceful, Yukinoshita can intentionally misunderstood\r\nits meaning, and complicate things further, by using the debate where theyre\r\nonly asked to apply self restraint, but the final decision still lies in the hands\r\nof the student council.\r\nI said that with a bitter smile, being aware that Yukinoshita probably knows\r\nbetter of the situation than I do.\r\nWhich Yukinoshita replied without raising her eyebrows:\r\n\"If possible I prefer not to take such a risk,\"\r\n\"while using the ambiguity of the term against them could work. But simply\r\nshowing them an unyielding attitude wont be enough.\"\r\n\"I am aware of that too, so well only use this to open up a platform for\r\ndiscussions.\"\r\nJust as she said, to forcefully conduct the prom, is merely a self destructing\r\nthat will only work once. Such a reckless decision cannot be made if they still\r\nplan to organize the prom for the years to come.\r\nTheir current plan is to apply their self restraining status as their means to\r\nnegotiate with the parents.\r\nWe might organize it without school supervision, we might set up the venue\r\nat somewhere not within school grounds, we might do something that goes\r\nbeyond your imaginable level of extremeness, are you still fine with it?\r\nThreatening them with such statements.\r\nEven if the student council wont actually do such things, it is an effective\r\nmethod to make the parents accept their request to negotiate.\r\nIt is the hard way to do things, but it will open up room for negotiation.\r\n\r\n56\r\n\r\n\r\nBut what matters afterwards, is what material can they present during the\r\nnegotiation.\r\nI stood up, and walked over to move the whiteboard. Yukinoshita sighed, but\r\ndid not attempt to stop me.\r\nI pulled out the whiteboard and flipped it over.\r\nAs I expected, suggestions of the strategy they can take has been written on\r\nthe whiteboard, and other information that relates to the new direction the\r\nprom will take.\r\nIt seems that they had quite a discussion, traces of their discussion were left\r\non every corner on the board has. There are two different kinds of\r\nhandwriting and writing style on the board, which seemingly belongs to\r\nYukinoshita and Iroha.\r\nThe sentences that mostly end with a question mark, but properly phrased and\r\nwritten horizontally were probably written by Yukinoshita, while the clump\r\nof sentences that end with a large exclamation mark seems to belong to Iroha.\r\nJudging from the order those sentences were arranged in, Yukinoshita and\r\nIroha each came out with one suggestion at a time, and proceeded to\r\ncomment on each others suggestion, in order to find out which idea is better\r\nand the possible improvements.\r\n\"So you two came out with these ideas?\"\r\n\"More accurately, I question Yukinoshita senpais idea, while Yukinoshita\r\nsenpai refutes my suggestions.\"\r\n\"Is that so, then its quite the constructive discussion you had there.\"\r\nGiving more than one suggestion is important when one reaches a stagnant\r\nsituation. At least theyre able to more options, and both suggestions can\r\ncompromise with each other, but being too fixated on denying each other\r\n\r\n57\r\n\r\n\r\nwont make things progress either.\r\nOnly by forming an opposing situation, the discussion could move forward.\r\nBut merely pointing out whether the suggestions would work, will only make\r\nthem reach a yes or no kind of conclusion.\r\nSo, exactly what kind of conclusion have came to...eh? Among all the written\r\nthings, I cant seem to spot something that feels identical to a conclusion, its\r\nlike reading through a note that only its owner can understand.\r\n\"...So, wheres your conclusion?\"\r\n\"Lets see...the ones in the red circle.\"\r\nAs Iroha answered, I took another look at the whiteboard, there are indeed a\r\nfew spots that are circled in red.\r\nGorgeous, wholesome, dress code restriction, supporting guidelines,\r\nsupervising officials, upload prohibited, OK!\r\nThats all of them.\r\n\"Hmmm...I kinda understo...no wait wait wait, I dont understand whats\r\ngoing on here at all.\"\r\nLike, what is this, a spot the word game? I felt like I can understand it yet I\r\ncant at the same time...what am I looking at exactly?\r\nI looked back, hoping for an explanation.\r\nYukinoshita then placed her finger on the cup mouth, looking at the gently\r\nswinging waves on the surface of the tea.\r\n\"I was still sorting things out when you came.\"\r\n\"Oh, that was...sorry for interrupting.\"\r\n\r\n58\r\n\r\n\r\nYukinoshita sounded as if she was simply stating a fact with no intent of\r\nblaming anyone, which made me stutter at my words. From how she was\r\nstanding in front of the board when I first stepped into the room, it does seem\r\nthat Yukinoshita was finalizing things. I apologized for my sudden\r\ninterruption, which she gently shook her head, telling me not to mind.\r\nTo shift away from this awkward atmosphere, I cleared up my throat and ask\r\nwith a clear voice:\r\n\"So, what are these words supposed to mean. I dont really get it\"\r\nThis time, it was Yukinoshita who seemed awkward, pausing for a short\r\nmoment before she answered:\r\n\"...As I said, were still reviewing the proposal.\"\r\nShe looked down and didnt say anything further. Well, considering that\r\nYukinoshita doesnt want me to be involved, it make sense that she would\r\nprefer not to elaborate any further.\r\nWhich means, ready, se, no, Irohasu chan~ I briefly glanced at Iroha, which\r\nshe replied while showing a reluctant face.\r\n\"Um...to put it simple, our current focus is to... make amendments on our\r\nclothing restrictions? Am I saying this right Yukinoshita senpai?\"\r\nAs Iroha turned over to confirm with Yukinoshita, probably thinking that its\r\nnot good to just ignore her, Yukinoshita answered reluctantly.\r\n\"We plan to enforce our dress code to prohibit extravagant or very revealing\r\nclothes. After properly defining the proper requirements, well contact the\r\nclothing renter from our side to prepare a suitable catalog.\"\r\n\"Oh...\"\r\nI see. Setting up a standard for the acceptable dresses, in order to guarantee\r\nthe wholesomeness on the appearances of the students during the event. And\r\n\r\n59\r\n\r\n\r\nmost students will prefer renting clothes through the student council, so\r\ntheyll naturally have to adhere to the dress code guidelines. But there are also\r\nexceptions...\r\n\"What about students who intends to wear their own clothes?\"\r\nIroha then pointed towards the circled words and answered.\r\n\"Since most participants will be wearing clothes that meets our guidelines,\r\nthose students will most probably restrain themselves to not stand out too\r\nmuch from the group.\"\r\n\"Right, peer pressure.\"\r\n\"Thats not a nice word to describe it...\"\r\nIroha glared at me, looking disgusted and unhappy. But isnt that exactly what\r\nshe meant...\r\nEven then, I doubt that everyone would accept to blend in with the crowd. No\r\nmatter which era were in there will always be that one eccentric person with\r\na thought like \"I will walk my own path even if that means being different\r\nfrom the others!! Look at my erotic image that makes me stand out from dem\r\nplebs!! Itspartytime!!\", while placing a Pichelle on top of their heads\r\n(Ref 1: A Japan fashion magazine).\r\n\"But wouldnt there still be a few students who would wear ridiculous\r\nclothing on the purpose of gaining attention? It is an important moment in\r\ntheir school life, after all.\"\r\n\"Were aware of such a possibility. So existing countermeasures have already\r\nbeen planned.\"\r\nYukinoshita gave a direct answer, but did not further elaborate on her\r\nstatement. But take a better look at these clues, and the answer will\r\neventually reveal itself.\r\n\r\n60\r\n','Oregairu Vol 13 - part 3.txt','uploaded/doc/Oregairu Vol 13 - part 3.txt','uploaded/img/aweawe.jpg.jpeg','\"\n',3964,'2020-11-15 18:35:51','2020-11-15 18:35:51'),(14,'Oregairu Vol. 13 Ch.4','Volume 13 starts with Hachiman arriving at the staff room to talk with Hiratsuka','Bringing up codependency will only stress us off. So for now its better to\r\navoid dealing with this matter, and work on the other important issues. Our\r\nthoughts might differ, but we have the common topic of making the prom a\r\nsuccess, and that should allow us to have a constructive discussion.\r\nBut man, why is Iroha still putting up that doubtful face...\r\n\"How to start up the conversation huh...cant say that I trust senpai on that.\"\r\n\"Yeah, sure sucks to have low credibility.\"\r\nBeing self aware of my life decisions that hardly earned me any credibility, I\r\nshrugged lightly.\r\nIroha then stood silent for a moment as if shes trying to observe something,\r\nand let out a deep sigh. Guess shes just felt speechless towards me.\r\n\"Senpai, youre being overprotective again.\"\r\nAs Iroha said so, she walked towards me, gripped onto the edges of her skirt,\r\nand gently sat beside me. She held onto her forehead, slightly lifting her chin.\r\nHer hair rustled lightly as they moved across her elbows, glimmering under\r\nthe sunset, she started to gaze at somewhere beyond the windows in front of\r\nus.\r\n\"Im sure that, Yukinoshita senpai is trying her best here. Not that I cant\r\nunderstand how she felt.\"\r\n\"...Well, she definitely is.\"\r\nI lay down my hands behind me, and stared at the ceiling above.\r\nPerhaps Irohas respond is a better idea. When someone has the intent to\r\ncomplete something alone, for the others to take a step back and see things\r\nthrough is probably whats better for that person\r\n\"Even so...you still plan to help her?\"\r\n\r\n43\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking towards the direction of her voice, Irohas hand continued to lay on\r\nher forehead, while slightly turning her head towards me, as if shes\r\nobserving my reactions. Even if this action felt pretty childish, very cute, but\r\na chilling sense of seriousness lies within her eyes.\r\n\"...That is my intention.\"\r\nWhile I cant trust my dead fish eyeballs to make me look serious at all, I\r\ntried to compensate by deepening my tone. Iroha stayed silent for a while,\r\nseemingly considering something, then asked me in a soft tone:\r\n\"Even if...doing so wouldnt benefit Yukinoshita senpai at all, youll still offer\r\nyour aid?\r\n\"I never really acted out on the intent of benefiting anyone in the first place,\r\nso Im just doing the usual here...yeah.\"\r\n\"Doing the usual...huh.\"\r\nI nodded in reply as she muttered those words in a confused tone. Iroha then\r\nlaid her head down, while I turned my head to look at the windows\r\nThe outcomes have always been the same.\r\nMy words and actions have always end up being far from the correct\r\nsolution. An endless cycle of misunderstanding things and making mistakes,\r\neven my apology didnt end up well, like a row of buttons that continue to\r\nend up in the wrong hole of the shirt.\r\nThis has been repeating throughout the whole year, and before I realize it,\r\nwinter is almost over, the strong winds that indicates the incoming of spring\r\nrattles the windows, breaking this short moment of silence.\r\n\"To be honest, I dont think that Yukinoshita senpai will accept your offer.\"\r\n\"Indeed...\"\r\nI accidentally let out a deep sigh, Iroha then came closer and continued\r\nsaying:\r\n44\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In fact, youll probably be cruelly rejected.\"\r\n\"Thats probably the case...\"\r\nI sighed once again, Iroha moved even closer and stared at me:\r\n\"Even so, you still want to help?\"\r\n\"Of course Ill help...\"\r\nHearing my answer that was followed up by another sigh, Iroha opened her\r\nmouth wide while leaning her head to her right:\r\n\"Huh!? But why bruh?\"\r\n\"Well for why Im doing so...\"\r\nIs it really that shocking, she even stopped using honorifics at this point, not\r\nthat it really matters...But, did she forgot what she said in the first place...\r\n\"Werent you the one who asked for my help in the first place...\"\r\nAs I said that, Iroha looks frozen for a moment, blinked her eyes for a few\r\ntimes. Then took a quick step back, and then shook her hands, while saying\r\nrapidly:\r\n\"Wha...what? Are you doing it for me?! What the hell do you have a crush on\r\nme or something even though I have always received your help even though\r\nyou always treated me nicely and even though I dont dislike you but there\r\nare too many things that need to be cleared up for now so lets put this off for\r\nanother time sorrymasen.\"\r\nShe quickly followed up with a deep bow. Which I responded by nodding my\r\nhead in satisfaction.\r\n\"Ah yes, now thats what Im looking for. It sounds different from the usual\r\nbut whatever.\"\r\n\"Whats with this comment...its the same as the usual isnt it?\"\r\n\r\n45\r\n\r\n\r\nMuttered Iroha unhappily, she seems to have glared at me too. Yeah\r\nwhatever, thats the reaction I expected...taking a distance away from me as I\r\nlie down feeling exhausted, Iroha pointed at her cheeks with her index finger,\r\nwhile saying with a poker face.\r\n\"I wont mind if you use me as an excuse, though.\"\r\n\"Bad excuse, and its not the real reason after all...\"\r\nIroha ignored my correction, and continued poking her cheek, looking\r\ntroubled:\r\n\"But to be fair, I doubt that wouldnt be the kind of reason Yukinoshita senpai\r\nwill accept either.\"\r\n\"Of course its not...how did we loop back to this? But hey, at least our great\r\nIrohasu can help by saying a few goods throughout our conversation, no?\"\r\n\"Eh...I dont want to... Also it impossible for me to do so.\"\r\n\"Impossible... Even answering that in an instant...\"\r\nWait, did she seriously just said I dont want to? As I looked towards her,\r\nwondering if I misheard Mada Mada for Yada Yada, Iroha made a soft\r\ncough, then patted on her chest for no reason and said:\r\n\"Yes, a girls decision cannot be easily be changed. Well, but if its something\r\ndecided by someone else we can simply make amends to it, if that decision is\r\na pain we can act like we forgotten it.\"\r\n\"Youre the worst...\"\r\nNonono, thats just you isnt it? Its not a girls exclusive thing, but varies from\r\none to another. The kind of equality where everyone can be All Might is\r\nsomething that a person without talents like me believes in.\r\nAs she turned back towards me, Iroha said with a worried face.\r\n\"And considering that its Yukinoshita senpai were dealing with here, its\r\n\r\n46\r\n\r\n\r\ngoing to be hard isnt it...\"\r\n\"Of course, of course it would be...\"\r\nNot because its a girls decision, but Yukinoshitas decision, a decision that I\r\ncant go against easily. Looking back at my year long experiences of\r\ninteracting with her, its obvious that Yukinoshitas honesty and seriousness\r\nwont allow her to take back those words that easily.\r\nShutting her eyes closed, crossing her arms, Iroha made a short groan and\r\nsaid.\r\n\"For this time, I can feel that she has been caring for me a lot...so I felt like\r\nsupporting her decision too.\"\r\nShe then stated her final stand with a bitter smile:\r\n\"Which is why, I cant bring myself to help out in persuading her, Im sorry\r\nsenpai.\"\r\nI told her not to worry while making my best smile possible, which she\r\nreplied with a gentle nod. For my random idea of her saying some good\r\nthings to Yukinoshita, she listened properly and even considered things\r\nthoroughly. I have to say, Isshiki Iroha really is a much decent person than\r\nhow I used to judge her. Which made me feel sorry for attempting to drag her\r\ninto such a messy issue.\r\nYes, I should be the one to do the planning.\r\n...Now then, how should I tell her exactly? I cant figure it out, she is truly a\r\nbig trouble, that girl...but when it comes to being a troublesome Im the same\r\nas her, perhaps even more troublesome in comparison.\r\nI started to rub on my forehead to have a better blood flow around my brain,\r\nwhile doing so, Iroha kept staring at me without making a sound.\r\n\"......\"\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n47\r\n\r\n\r\nI asked as I realize her view focusing on me, she shook her head and\r\nanswered.\r\n\"Not really, I was just thinking on how persistent you are.\"\r\n\"Ah...well yes.\"\r\nTo hear such a direct comment, while being stared by her, I find myself in a\r\nlack myself of words. Thus I could only reply in such a short, incomplete\r\nmanner. Iroha slowly walked near me until reaching an arms distance, while\r\ncontinuing to look into my eyes.\r\n\"But why? Being rejected by Yukinoshita senpai by herself, and after hearing\r\nsuch words from Haruno senpai. For what exact reason are you pushing\r\nyourself this much? When it comes to such a sticky situation one would\r\nsimply stay away as far as possible, isnt it so.\"\r\nShe phrased her question in a way that doesnt allow me a chance to answer.\r\nEven if I could, I doubt that I can come out with a proper answer.\r\nIroha steps closer every time she asks a question, while I move back to\r\nmaintain our distance, to the point I could feel the back of my legs pressing\r\nitself onto the bench.\r\n\"Theres a lot of reasons behind it...\"\r\nRealizing that there is no further space for me to move away, I could only\r\navoid looking directly at her, but Iroha proceeded to grab onto my tie.\r\n\"Please answer me seriously, senpai.\"\r\nIroha forcefully re turned my head towards her, the obvious twist on my\r\nnecktie tells me that shes applying a lot of strength onto it.\r\nIm unable to look away, neither could I avert my line of view from the image\r\nof Irohas soft lips and glowing eyes. In front of her determined expression, I\r\ncould only do my best to open my heavy mouth.\r\n\"I swear, there really are a lot of reasons behind it, its impossible to state each\r\n48\r\n\r\n\r\nof them clearly just yet...\"\r\n\"Its fine even if you said it vaguely.\"\r\nIroha does not give any room for me to play around with words, removing all\r\nchances for me to remain silent.\r\nBut how exactly should I phrase it to make her understand better.\r\nThese painful feelings are not something that could be simply expressed\r\nthrough words, but whats more troublesome about them is that they could be\r\ndescribed and be interpreted as anything within the acceptable range. Such a\r\ntranslucent, unclear, shapeless thing. To apply existing words onto it will\r\nonly slowly chip it off from the sides to the point it reaches degradation,\r\nending up as a total mistake.\r\nMore importantly, I could not accept the act of simplifying things into one\r\nsingle sentence.\r\nUp until now, Ive always relied on excuses like bringing my sister into the\r\npicture, or stating that Im just doing my job. Even just now, I tried using\r\nIrohas request as an excuse, something that she would usually get along with.\r\nBut what Iroha Isshiki wanted is not such dishonest words. Her eyes keep\r\ntelling me that,\r\nit doesnt need to come with a motive, it doesnt need a proper elaboration,\r\nits fine for me to make it unclear, its fine for me to say it vaguely.\r\nShow me your answer.\r\n\"......I have a responsibility.\"\r\n\"Responsibility, huh.\"\r\nMuttered Iroha in a low voice, she took a short breath, and slightly inclined\r\nher head.\r\n\r\n','Oregairu Vol 13 - part 4.txt','uploaded/doc/Oregairu Vol 13 - part 4.txt','uploaded/img/eaeaea.jpg.jpeg','Bringing up codependency will only stress us off\n',1447,'2020-11-15 18:41:16','2020-11-15 18:41:16'),(15,'Oregairu Vol. 13 Ch.5','Volume 13 starts with Hachiman arriving at the staff room to talk with Hiratsuka','\"Are you stupid or something? Why did you have to make things so\r\nconflicting?\"\r\n\"No, listen. Its not just me, Yukinoshita also acted really...\"\r\nI tried to give an excuse, but Iroha refused to listen, made a hmph sound and\r\nturned over, starting to walk away, I proceeded to follow behind her.\r\n\"Listen to me alright? You saw that didnt you, how stubborn, how super\r\nduper troublesome...\"\r\n\"Oh hey, good job with your most accurate self-introduction ever.\"\r\n\"Youre welco... wait Im not talking about me. Even though I did acted the\r\nsame way back there.\"\r\nSaying that, I sped up my footsteps in order to catch up with Iroha. However,\r\nthe distance between did not shorten at all.\r\n\"By the way, arent you walking a little too fast? This is the kind of speed one\r\nuses when theyre trying to get rid of this random annoying guy in front of the\r\ntrain station.\"\r\n\"Ah, I dont need these.\"\r\nWithout looking back back, Iroha replied in a low tone.\r\nYup, that was cold. I guess she wont turn around even if I start shouting\r\nVanilla Vanilla high income[7]. So I continued to follow her footsteps.\r\nIf my memory serves me well, Iroha should be heading to the station a mile\r\nahead of us. Even if the trains we take go in opposite directions, well still\r\nhave to start out at the same station.\r\nSo I continued to step upon Irohas shadow for quite some time.\r\nDuring this period, neither me or Iroha said a single word. Only the rustling\r\nsounds of dried leaves, the ringing sounds of the bicycles passing by, and the\r\nroaring sounds of the wind could be heard.\r\n\r\n81\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is natural for Iroha to feel so frustrated. The conversation between me and\r\nYukinoshita never felt coordinated throughout the process, to the point that I\r\nhad to declare my opposition against her. Iroha who was unaware about the\r\ncompetition going on in the Service Club probably felt really confused. I\r\neven promised her that Ill talk it through properly before we enter the student\r\ncouncil, for things to result in such a way. I really felt sorry.\r\nI guess its better if I apologize to her huh... as I was thinking, Iroha suddenly\r\nstopped in her tracks. Standing on the small road beside a park, and under the\r\ndim lights from the two vending machines nearby, she let out a weak,\r\nfrustrated breath.\r\nShe then turned around, looking at me speechlessly. She then pointed her\r\nfinger at the vending machine while remaining silent.\r\nIs she asking for a treat? Well, if this can change her mood for the better, then\r\nits definitely a worthwhile investment. But to look it in another way, shes\r\nalso offering a peace treaty through me buying her a drink. What a nice\r\nperson....\r\nI put some coins into the vending machine and started to choose drinks.\r\nWarm max coffee and...milk tea? No, perhaps bean soup is a better option......\r\nor corn soup should be fine too. Eh, whatever. I then pressed on the button.\r\nI then handed over the drinks that I chosen at random, Max coffee on my\r\nright hand, bean soup on the other. Iroha looked at my drinks of choice and\r\nshown a sign of disgust.\r\n\"Why does it have to be these two...\"\r\nWhile complaining, probably thinking that its not nice to straight up refuse,\r\nshe took the can of bean soup reluctantly. Chiba residents are surprisingly\r\nincompatible with Max coffee huh...\r\nShe then squatted down, leaning her back onto the vending machine, took of\r\nher gloves, open up the bean soup, and took a sip. Releasing a puff of white\r\ngas in the process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngood person. Such a beautiful mentor pupil love...That Iroha, who gets\r\nscolded by Hiratsuka on a daily basis, and always shrugs off her comment\r\nwith a poker face.... Hiratsuka sensei, your love has really reached into your\r\nstudents hearts...\r\nAs I was feeling moved, Iroha silently gazed away and whispered.\r\n\"Ah, well, yeah, I dont... to that kind of degree you know.\"\r\n\"Erm? What? What did you just say?\"\r\nBut then again, this sounded more like a shitty excuse than an actual reason.\r\nIroha cleared up her throat through a few light coughs, then made a really\r\ncute smile, and looked at me teasingly.\r\n\"Well, isnt senpai the exact same kind of person? The kind of person who,\r\nwill tell himself that he didnt manage to do anything, and feel regretful over\r\nit.\"\r\n\"Well yeah, I guess so...\"\r\nIt is true that Im currently feeling regretful at the moment, which made my\r\ntrue feelings blend into my voice, giving it a sense of solidness. Iroha then\r\nnodded in satisfaction.\r\n\"Im probably this type of person too.\"\r\nHer words surprised me a little. As I looked at her in confusion, Iroha made a\r\npale, lonely smile, and looked into the distance.\r\n\"I mean even for someone like me, I dont actually have a lot of friends, isnt\r\nso?\"\r\n\"What kind of person did think you look from the outside...\"\r\n\"Uhm hmm.\"\r\n\"Please continue\"\r\n\r\n86\r\n\r\n\r\nRealizing that Ive interrupted her, I nodded a few times as an apology, and\r\nallowed her to continue. Iroha gave me a cold look, and sighed deeply, she\r\nthen lowered her head, playing with a small stone beside her shoes, and\r\nslowly continued to speak.\r\n\"I only have you senpais. Which is why, I wanted to properly send of you,\r\nYukino and Yui senpai, Hayama senpai...and even Tobe senpai and a lot of\r\nmy other senpais off.\"\r\nHer intermittent words weaved themselves into a gentle sound, which made\r\nthe edges of my mouth to lose tension. Boi, what an incredible kouhai that I\r\nhave here. If I dont reply her with a joking manner, I might really wet my\r\neyes before I know it.\r\n\"Ahaha, were you always that good of a person?\"\r\n\"Im doing this so that I wont have any regrets. It was all for myself, not for\r\nthe sake of you senpais alright.\"\r\nIroha emphasized her intent, and made a hmph sound while raising up her\r\nchest. Under the illumination of the vending machine, her slightly reddish\r\nears were exposed among her swaying hair. I should probably pretend that I\r\nnever saw that.\r\nTo claim that all her actions were for the sake of herself, I dont necessarily\r\ndislike such an attitude.\r\n\"...And thats why I wanted to make a prom.\"\r\nIroha looked up into the night sky with a dreamy expression, saying out her\r\nwishes.\r\n\"Like this, to purposely work on something troublesome, spend a lot of time,\r\nto think, to drown deep in thoughts, to the point where we feel stressful,\r\npanicked, and starting to feel tired of each other ... and finally find ourselves\r\nat peace, letting go of something we once held dear to. Is this not a refreshing\r\nway to bid farewell?\"\r\n\r\n87\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking at how Iroha raised up both of her arms with a wow, I finally\r\nunderstood what she was talking about.\r\nThat process she said of is probably the path that I once walked on. Can I\r\nstruggle till the end in such an unpleasant way, and willingly accept our\r\nseparation?\r\n\"... Well, its not that hard to understand.\"\r\n\"Really?\"\r\nAsked Iroha half teasingly towards the words that went out of my mouth.\r\nEven if I knew that she was joking around, her eyes that are staring at me\r\nshone with sincerity. So, I remained silent, only showing her a faint smile.\r\n\"If thats the case...\"\r\nSaying that, Iroha pulled onto the my scarf and stood up. She the made a turn\r\nwith her arm, and wrapped it around my neck like a gymnastic ribbon.\r\n\"Then be a little serious.\"\r\nEven though shes still wearing a smile on her face, yet using a tone\r\ncompletely different from the joking sounds from just now, she rebuked me.\r\nThis distance where we can feel each others white breath, and the surprise\r\nfrom being scolded by a girl who is younger than me, made me froze for a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n88\r\n\r\n\r\n89\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ah, ah, sorry...\"\r\nI took a few millimeters of distance away from her, and readjusted my scarf.\r\nIn order to hide my surprised and blushing face ninja style.\r\nSeeing my reaction, Iroha sighed deeply, and then grabbed onto the corner of\r\nmy scarf, playing with it.\r\n\"If you start acting more serious, I cant get myself to feel serious too. Its a\r\nproblem alright, this kind of thing. Its so annoying to think of, its so hard to\r\ndeal with, and its so troublesome. Like very very troublesome.\"\r\nSaid Iroha, as she tightens the scarf, pinching it onto my chest. After she\r\nbeautifully rolled the scarf to the point no air could pass through its gaps, she\r\ngave me a neko punch across the scarf.\r\n\"Ouch it hurts...\"\r\nAcross the soft gloves and tightly wrapped scarf, I dont feel any pain from\r\nher fist at all.\r\nYet, its sensation continues to echo solidly within my chest.\r\n\r\n90\r\n\r\n\r\n3-2\r\nI turned on the lights in the living room, and whispered that I have returned.\r\nHowever no one responded, only the chilly air swirls within the house.\r\nMy parents are still at work, Komachi might have gone out too. So wheres\r\nour beloved cat ... I made some thinking, and flipped up the quilt placed over\r\nthe heater. Among the darkness, a pair of flashy things could be seen, my\r\neyes lined up with that of Kamakuras, whos lying down comfortably beside\r\nour heating machine.\r\nKamakura simply stared at my face, not meowing nor growling, staying\r\nmotionless. Telling me through its eyes \"Human, the cold air is entering,\r\nhurry up and close the kotatsu.\" Huh, it greets Komachi whenever Komachi\r\nshe comes back, but treats me with such an attitude? Why cant he be a little\r\nmore close to me, guess Kamakura doesnt like me getting near him huh... I\r\nfelt uneasy with that thought, telling him \"Im back.\", let go of the blanket,\r\nwhile turning on the switch to the heater, which tends to be turned off when\r\nno one is left in the house... Time to warm myself up...\r\nSince the cat already had its share of air conditioning, its time for the human\r\nto enjoy his. I pressed on the remote control, adjusting the air conditioner to\r\ngreenhouse mode. Warm air then started to blow out, which made me finally\r\nfeel comfortable. I untied the scarf wrapped around my neck, and took a deep\r\nbreath.\r\nI would usually spend the next few hours laying around lazily, but I dont\r\nhave that much free time to stay comfy right now.\r\nAfter taking off my coat, I lay down on the sofa. Held my phone in my hands,\r\nand started to search for information. The keywords being, prom nights.\r\nI will make the prom happen, even though I made such a solid statement,\r\nand even though me and Yukinoshita have decided on the directions well\r\ntake on separately. Im still lacking actual content and resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n','Oregairu Vol 13 - part 5.txt','uploaded/doc/Oregairu Vol 13 - part 5.txt','uploaded/img/yukinoo.jpg.jpeg','\"Are you stupid or something?
