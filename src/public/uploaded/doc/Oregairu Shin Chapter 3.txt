OreGairu Shin will tell the story of the protagonists in their third year of high school, and will be divided into 6 mini-volumes, where each mini-volume will have approximately 100 pages, although that amount may vary, since the first mini-volume that was published has 90 pages.

Now, a brief summary of this new history will be made.

SUMMARY
Hikigaya tells his sister that he is dating Yukino. And upon hearing the news, Komachi is happy for her brother, although she also gets a little jealous, but only a little.


And as he keeps talking about Yukino, Hikigaya is embarrassed, as he still doesn't feel ready to talk about his girlfriend. So he tries to use some uncomfortable words with his sister, but eventually he blushes at what he says.

After that, Hikigaya is in his classroom. And it turns out that the third year students have been divided into a new class, where Hikigaya, Ebina and Hayato end up together.

In this new class, Hayato sits behind Hikigaya, and when she sees them, Ebina gets excited.

A new girl appears. She has short black hair, and is the new class instructor, and perhaps the only girl Hikigaya remembers.

This new girl approaches Hikigaya and Hayama, and invites them to a special party for the third year students. But Hikigaya tells her that he won't be able to go, since after all, he has a dinner with Yukino's mom.


On the other hand, Komachi has become the president of the Service Club. Now, she has taken it upon herself to change everyone's positions, which makes Hikigaya feel that everyone is now closer.

Then we see Hikigaya getting ready to go to dinner with Yukino's family. And once the dinner is over, Yukino tells Hikigaya that she wants to introduce him to her dad. A new enemy has appeared?

Additional: Before dinner with Haruno and Yukino's mom, Hikigaya was very nervous, to the point that he forgot to put on his tie, so he tells Yukino that he won't be able to have dinner with her family because he is not properly dressed. But for his bad luck, Komachi foresaw the situation and gave Yukino a tie, who in the end put it on her beloved boyfriend...
