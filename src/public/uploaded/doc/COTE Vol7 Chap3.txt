As the last lesson was finishing up, some of class C entered class D and Chabashira left. The ones who showed up were Ryuuen, Ishizaki, and Yamada Albert (also Komiya and Kondou). Ryuuen says he’s come to warn them. In the tense atmosphere, the only one able to move as if nothing’s happening is Kouenji, who leaves. Ryuuen’s target was Kouenji as he sends his men after him. Ayanokoji notes that Kushida’s role has become far less present but not faded, as the class gossips.

Ayanokoji, Miyake with some other people go to check on Kouenji. Someone (I can’t remember) suggest he’s going back to the dorm. As they head towards the dorms they see class C surround Kouenji. Class D decides to just observe for now. Kouenji acts like Kouenji (arrogant) but realizes Ryuuen won’t let him go until they finish their business so they go to a rest area.

Ayanokoji suspects that this was just a ploy to narrow down the people who could be X. Kouenji trolls Ryuuen some more and gets him to hold a mirror while he does his hair. This pisses Ryuuen off and he throws the mirror on the ground. 

Sakayanagi, Kamuro and 2 boys then also show up. Kouenji says he wants to leave, but Ryuuen’s lackey stops him. Ryuuen suspects him due to the results from the Zodiac Exam. Kouenji denies and says if he came to that conclusion he must be a moron. 

Ryuuen then asks Kouenji for his opinion on who X is, but before he does he’s cut off by Sakayanagi, who points to the possibility of Ryuuen just being sour he lost to class D. Sakayanagi then reveals that the deal was that class C support class A in exchange for monthly paid private points. After some arguing, Ryuuen kicks Hashimoto, who was defending Sakayanagi, which caused quite a shock. They then rub some more salt in some wounds and everyone leaves.
