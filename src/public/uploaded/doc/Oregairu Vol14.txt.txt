Chapter 1: Even so, Hikigaya Hachiman's daily life continues.
Drops of water ran down my cheeks, and caused a series of small ripples on the surface below. It
was an eerily, silent morning with only the echoing plopping sounds of water.
I slightly opened my drenched eyelids, and caught a blurry glimpse of the water surface glittering
from the sunlight shining through the window. Living in the filled wash basin was a familiar set of
melancholic and drowsy eyes. I removed the cork stopper, and the faint cloudy water slowly
disappeared together with the oscillating reflection of my human image.
I roughly rubbed my face dry with a towel, and let out a deep breath. The odor of menthol from
the facial cleanser drifted through the air of the room. I looked in the mirror ahead, was met with a
face that carried its usual listless feature. However, it looked rather refreshed, partly due to the cooling
sensation of the water. My expression looked far better than it did compared to last night. Perhaps, it
was just that simple whenever something had ended.
Yesterday, the contest that dragged on for almost a year in the Service Club finally ended with my
loss. My faint breaths that penetrated the towel at my mouth appeared tinged with a sense of relief
instead of resignation. Now, it was all over.
