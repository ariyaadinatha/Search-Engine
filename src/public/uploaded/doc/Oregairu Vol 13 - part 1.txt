Again and again.
I look back again and again.
The distance widens and time passes.
I go far to the point I cant go back.
So that I can finally look back and remind myself of what was right.
Even while knowing this is a mistake, I persuade myself that this is the one
and only answer.
Again and again.
I look back again and again.
At the first light of day.
At the trickling rain and dew of the early afternoon.
At the light snowfall dancing as they scatter in the twilight.
At the hazy moon shaking in the midnight.
There was always a place and opportunity to answer, and that time, it looked
as if I would be guided towards the optimal solution.
However, it never looked as if the correct answer would be said.
Probably, maybe, surely.

Id thought this was probably for the best.
Id made an ambiguously grey decision that neither got it right nor far.
Maintaining a reasonable distance, not hurting anyone, neither right or
wrong, fact or fiction, and unclear.
It wasnt that I couldnt say what I wanted to, I just didnt know what I
wanted to say even was.
What right did someone like that have to say.
Thats why, at the very least.
I just want to be correct this time.
I dont want to forgive my errors or mistakes.
Because I cant afford to be wrong anymore.

Shizuka Reminisces the Past
Countless, countless times have I turned back my head.
Yet every step moves out without stopping.
Let my heartbeat accelerate , let my breathing fall out of place, and refused to
wipe off the accumulating sweat.
If I dont do this, every small detail might just become my excuse to stop. Yet
this doesnt stop me from looking back again and again, how disgusting.
That image of a single drop of tear right before we parted refuses to leave my
head.
The remaining traces of rainwater on the road, looks identical to the trace on
her cheeks. The puddles of water my running feet tries to avoid, the unnatural
disrupted footwork, every step screams, urging me to turn back.
But what can going back do for me, what should I say to do anything about
the situation.
No, there is a solution lying somewhere in my heart. Yet my legs refuses to
decide on any option, repeating its mechanical yet unnatural movement.
Even if a standard option exists, that isnt mine, that cant be our answer.
The sun slowly falls into the horizon, turning itself crimson red.
The shadows of houses elongate, to the point they seem so close to blending
