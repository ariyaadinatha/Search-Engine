Chapter 5: Gallantly, Hiratsuka Shizuka walks ahead.
The prom was held according to schedule. By the time we finished cleaning up the venue, it had
gotten late. We left the vacant gymnasium and moved to the conference room of the main building.
Everyone involved in the logistics of the prom were gathering there.
It wasn't a particularly large group. It included the following: the main staff consisting of the
student council and Yukinoshita, helper grunts from various clubs, Yuigahama, Hiratsuka-sensei,
individuals from the parents association, and me.
To acknowledge the achievements of all related persons such as the performers, staff, and others,
a quick and modest celebration, more akin to a milestone celebration, was held to acknowledge their
efforts.
Everyone surrounded a long table that was loaded with easy meals and beverages. Isshiki stood at
the front and darted her eyes around the room, confirming that everyone had a paper cup. Then, she
poked Yukinoshita beside her with her elbow.
Yukino-senpai, can you raise a toast?
M-Me? Yukinoshita said in befuddlement.
Isshiki nodded while silently pressuring her to get the formalities over with. The two engaged in a
brief unspoken back-and-forth staring contest, but eventually, Yukinoshita faltered with a sigh.
Then, I would like to take this moment to say a few things... Her eyebrows curved against each
other, and her mouth formed a bit of a pout. Looking reluctant, she took a step forward with her paper
cup. Then, she raised her face with an invigorated smile. We were able to successfully hold the prom
due to the support of everyone here. To the collaborators, I truly thank you for your cooperation. And I
would like to express my gratitude to the involved staff as well. Going forward, the prom will be
adopted as another tradition of Sobu High School, and I pray that we, the third years, can be sent off in
a similar fashion next year as well... Cheers.
Her long-winded toast indicated she was in fairly high-spirits as opposed to her visible reluctance
earlier. Afterwards, everyone cheered in unison. I held my cup up at a moderate height, and my
neighbor Yuigahama extended out her cup.
Great work today!
