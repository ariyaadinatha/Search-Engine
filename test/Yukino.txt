Yukino Yukinoshita is the female protagonist of Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru. She is the student of Class 2J of Sobu High School and the founding president of the Service Club. She was the only member until Hachiman Hikigaya joined her.

Yukino is quite popular even for her cold personality. Because of her look and skills in various fields, even Hachiman, who doesn't talk to anyone and doesn't even know his own classmate (Yui Yuigahama), recognized Yukino at the very instant he met her in the club room.

Yukino is a very beautiful teenage girl with waist-length black hair which is tied with two red ribbons by each shoulder (she changed her hairstyle into twin tails when she went out with Hachiman Hikigaya and Komachi Hikigaya (but ended up with just Yukino and Hachiman) to buy a birthday present for Yui Yuigahama) and angular blue eyes.

Yukino is mostly seen wearing her school uniform, which consists of a black blazer with a white shirt underneath it, a red ribbon tie, a plaid skirt and black stockings up to her knees.

Yukino is also sometimes seen with a blue scarf in winter.

Even though she is seen as flat-chested compared to most of the other female characters, she is still considered to be quite attractive.
